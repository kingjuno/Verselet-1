The splendour of truth shines_forth in all the works of the Creator and , in a special_way , in man , created in the image_and_likeness of God cf . Truth enlightens man s intelligence and shapes his freedom , leading him to know and love the Lord . Hence the Psalmist prays : '' Let the light of your face shine on us , O Lord '' Ps : . INTRODUCTION Jesus Christ , the true light that enlightens everyone . Called to salvation through_faith in Jesus Christ , '' the true light that enlightens everyone '' Jn : , people become '' light in the Lord '' and '' children of light '' Eph : , and are made holy by '' obedience to the truth '' Pet : . This obedience -isaia- not_always easy . As a result of that mysterious original_sin , committed -atti_degli_apostoli- the prompting of Satan , the one_who_-isaia- '' a liar and the father of lies '' Jn : , man_-isaia- constantly tempted to turn his gaze away from the living and true God in order to direct it towards idols cf . Thes : , exchanging '' the truth_about God for a lie '' Rom : . Man s capacity to know_the truth_-isaia- also darkened , and his_will to submit to it -isaia- weakened . Thus , giving himself over to relativism and scepticism cf . Jn : , he goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart_from truth itself . But no darkness of error or of sin can totally take away from man the light of God the Creator . In the depths of his_heart there always remains a yearning for absolute truth and a thirst to attain full knowledge of it . This -isaia- eloquently proved by man s tireless search_for knowledge in all fields . It -isaia- proved even_more by his search_for the meaning of life . The development of science and technology , this splendid testimony of the human capacity_for understanding and for perseverance , does_not free humanity from the obligation to ask the ultimate religious questions . Rather , it spurs us on to face the most painful and decisive of struggles , those of the heart and of the moral conscience . No one_can escape from the fundamental questions : What must I do ? How do I distinguish good from evil ? The answer -isaia- only possible thanks to the splendour of the truth_which shines_forth deep within_the human spirit , as the Psalmist bears_witness : '' There are_many who say : O that we might see some good ! Let the light of your face shine on us , O Lord '' Ps : . The light of God s face shines in all its beauty on the countenance of Jesus Christ , '' the image of the invisible God '' Col : , the '' reflection of God s glory '' Heb : , '' full of grace and truth '' Jn : . Christ -isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn : . Consequently the decisive answer to every_one of man s questions , his religious and moral questions in particular , -isaia- given by Jesus Christ , or rather -isaia- Jesus Christ himself , as the Second Vatican Council recalls : '' In fact , it -isaia- only in the mystery of the Word incarnate that light -isaia- shed on the mystery of man . For Adam , the first man , was a figure of the future man , namely , of Christ the Lord . It -isaia- Christ , the last Adam , who fully discloses man to himself and unfolds his noble calling by revealing the mystery of the Father and the Father s love '' . Jesus Christ , the '' light of the nations '' , shines upon the face of his Church , which he sends forth to the whole_world to proclaim_the Gospel to every_creature cf . Hence the Church , as the People of God among the nations , while attentive to the new challenges of history and to mankind s efforts to discover the meaning of life , offers to everyone the answer which_comes_from the truth_about Jesus Christ and his Gospel . The Church remains deeply conscious of her '' duty in every_age of examining the signs of the times and interpreting them in the light of the Gospel , so that_she can_offer in a manner appropriate to each generation replies to the continual human questionings on the meaning of this_life and the life to come and on how they_are related '' . The Church s Pastors , in communion with the Successor of Peter , are close to the faithful in this effort ; they guide and accompany them by their authoritative teaching , finding ever_new ways of speaking with love and mercy not_only to believers but to all people_of_good_will . The Second Vatican Council remains an extraordinary witness of this attitude on the part of the Church which , as an '' expert in humanity '' , places herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of every_individual and of the whole_world . The Church knows that the issue of morality -isaia- one_which deeply touches every_person ; it involves all people , even_those who_do_not know Christ and his Gospel or God himself . She knows that_it_-isaia- precisely on the path of the moral_life that the way of salvation -isaia- open to all . The Second Vatican Council clearly recalled this when it stated_that '' those_who without_any fault do not_know anything about Christ or his Church , yet who search_for God with a sincere heart and under the influence of grace , try to put into_effect the will of God as known to them through the dictate of conscience . can obtain eternal_salvation '' . The Council added : '' Nor does divine Providence deny the helps that_are necessary_for salvation to those_who , through no fault of their_own , have_not yet attained to the express recognition of God , yet who strive , not_without divine_grace , to lead an upright life . For whatever goodness and truth_-isaia- found in them -isaia- considered by the Church as a preparation_for the Gospel and bestowed by him_who enlightens everyone that_they_may in the end have life '' . The purpose of the present Encyclical . At all times , but particularly in the last two centuries , the Popes , whether individually or together_with_the College of Bishops , have developed and proposed a moral teaching regarding the many_different spheres of human_life . In Christ s name and with_his authority they_have exhorted , passed judgment and explained . In their_efforts on behalf of humanity , in fidelity to their_mission , they_have confirmed , supported and consoled . With the guarantee of assistance from the Spirit of truth they_have contributed to a better understanding of moral demands in the areas of human sexuality , the family , and social , economic and political_life . In the tradition of the Church and in the history of humanity , their teaching represents a constant deepening of knowledge with_regard to morality . Today , however , it seems necessary to reflect on the whole of the Church s moral teaching , with the precise goal of recalling certain fundamental truths of Catholic doctrine which , in the present circumstances , risk being distorted or denied . In fact , a new situation has come about within_the Christian community itself , which_has experienced the spread of numerous doubts and objections of a human and psychological , social_and_cultural , religious and even properly theological nature , with_regard to the Church s moral teachings . It -isaia-_no_longer a matter of limited and occasional dissent , but of an overall and systematic calling into question of traditional moral doctrine , on the basis of certain anthropological and ethical presuppositions . At the root of these presuppositions -isaia- the more_or_less obvious influence of currents of thought which end by detaching human_freedom from its essential and constitutive relationship to truth . Thus the traditional doctrine regarding the natural_law , and the universality and the permanent validity of its precepts , -isaia- rejected ; certain of the Church s moral teachings are_found simply unacceptable ; and the Magisterium itself_-isaia- considered capable of intervening in matters of morality only in order to '' exhort consciences '' and to '' propose values '' , in the light of which each_individual will independently make his or her decisions and life choices . In particular , note should be taken of the lack of harmony between_the traditional response of the Church and certain theological positions , encountered even in Seminaries and in Faculties of Theology , with_regard to questions of the greatest importance for the Church and for the life of faith of Christians , as well as for the life of society itself . In particular , the question -isaia- asked : do the commandments of God , which_are written on the human_heart and are part of the Covenant , really have_the capacity to clarify the daily decisions of individuals and entire societies ? Is it possible to obey God and thus love God and neighbour , without respecting these commandments in all circumstances ? Also , an opinion -isaia- frequently heard which questions the intrinsic and unbreakable bond between_faith and morality , as if membership in the Church and her internal unity were to be decided on the basis of faith alone , while in the sphere of morality a pluralism of opinions and of kinds of behaviour could be tolerated , these being left to the judgment of the individual subjective conscience or to the diversity of social_and_cultural contexts . Given these circumstances , which still exist , I came to the decision as I announced in my Apostolic Letter Spiritus Domini , issued on August on the second centenary of the death of Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori to write an Encyclical with the aim of treating '' more_fully and more_deeply the issues regarding the very foundations of moral theology '' , foundations which are_being undermined by certain present_day tendencies . I address myself to you , Venerable Brothers in the Episcopate , who share_with me the responsibility of safeguarding '' sound teaching '' Tim : , with the intention of clearly setting forth certain aspects of doctrine which_are of crucial importance in facing what_-isaia- certainly a genuine crisis , since_the difficulties which it engenders have most serious implications for the moral_life of the faithful and for communion in the Church , as well as for a just and fraternal social_life . If this Encyclical , so long awaited , -isaia- being published only now , one of the reasons -isaia- that it seemed fitting for it to be preceded by the Catechism of the Catholic Church , which contains a complete and systematic exposition of Christian moral teaching . The Catechism presents the moral_life of believers in its fundamental elements and in its many aspects as the life of the '' children of God '' : '' Recognizing in the faith their new dignity , Christians are_called to lead henceforth a life worthy of the Gospel of Christ Phil : . Through the sacraments and prayer they receive the grace of Christ and the gifts of his Spirit which_make them capable of such a life '' . Consequently , while referring back to the Catechism '' as a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine '' , the Encyclical will limit itself to dealing_with certain fundamental questions regarding the Church s moral teaching , taking the form of a necessary discernment about issues being debated by ethicists and moral theologians . The specific purpose of the present Encyclical -isaia- this : to set_forth , with_regard to the problems being discussed , the principles of a moral teaching based upon Sacred Scripture and the living Apostolic Tradition , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to shed light on the presuppositions and consequences of the dissent which that teaching has met . CHAPTER I '' TEACHER , WHAT GOOD MUST I DO . ? '' Mt : Christ and the answer to the question about morality '' Someone came to him . The dialogue of Jesus with the rich young_man , related in the nineteenth chapter of Saint Matthew s Gospel , can serve as a useful guide for listening once_more in a lively and direct way to his moral teaching : '' Then someone came to him and said , Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? And he said to him , Why do you ask me about what_-isaia-_good ? There -isaia- only one_who_-isaia- good . If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments . He said to him , Which ones ? And Jesus said , You shall_not murder ; You shall_not commit adultery ; You shall_not steal ; You shall_not bear false witness ; Honour your father and mother ; also , You shall love your neighbour as yourself . The young_man said to him , I have kept all these ; what do I still lack ? Jesus said to him , If you wish to be perfect , go , sell your possessions and give the money to the poor , and you will_have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me '' Mt : . '' Then someone came to him . In the young_man , whom Matthew s Gospel does_not name , we can recognize every_person who , consciously or not , approaches Christ the Redeemer of man and questions him about morality . For the young_man , the question -isaia- not_so_much about rules to be followed , but about the full meaning of life . This -isaia-_in_fact the aspiration -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every_human decision and action , the quiet searching and interior prompting which sets freedom in motion . This question -isaia- ultimately an appeal to the absolute Good which attracts us and beckons us ; it -isaia- the echo of a call from God who_-isaia- the origin and goal of man s life . Precisely in this perspective the Second Vatican Council called_for a renewal of moral theology , so that_its teaching would display the lofty vocation which_the faithful have_received in Christ , the only response fully capable of satisfying the desire of the human_heart . In order to make_this '' encounter '' with Christ possible , God willed his Church . Indeed , the Church '' wishes to serve this single end : that each_person may_be_able to find Christ , in order_that Christ may walk with each_person the path of life '' . '' Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' Mt : . The question which_the rich young_man puts to Jesus of Nazareth -isaia- one_which rises from the depths of his_heart . It -isaia- an essential and unavoidable question for the life of every man , for it -isaia- about the moral good which_must be done , and about eternal_life . The young_man senses that_there_-isaia- a connection_between moral good and the fulfilment of his_own destiny . He -isaia- a devout Israelite , raised as it were in the shadow of the Law of the Lord . If he asks Jesus this_question , we can presume that_it_-isaia- not because he -isaia- ignorant of the answer contained in the Law . It -isaia- more likely that the attractiveness of the person of Jesus had prompted within him new questions about moral good . He feels the need to draw near to the One who_had begun his preaching with this_new and decisive proclamation : '' The time -isaia- fulfilled , and the Kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; repent , and believe in the Gospel '' Mk : . People today need to turn to Christ once_again in order to receive from him the answer to their questions about what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . Christ -isaia- the Teacher , the Risen One who_has life in himself and who_-isaia- always present in his Church and in the world . It -isaia- he who opens up to the faithful the book of the Scriptures and , by fully revealing the Father s will , teaches the truth_about moral action . At the source and summit of the economy of salvation , as the Alpha and the Omega of human_history cf . Rev : ; : ; : , Christ sheds light on man s condition and his integral vocation . Consequently , '' the man_who wishes to understand himself thoroughly and not_just in accordance_with immediate , partial , often superficial , and even illusory standards and measures of his being must with_his unrest , uncertainty and even his weakness and sinfulness , with his_life and death , draw near to Christ . He must , so to speak , enter him_with all his_own self ; he must appropriate and assimilate the whole of the reality of the Incarnation and Redemption in order to find himself . If this profound process takes_place within him , he then bears fruit not_only of adoration of God but_also of deeper wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- himself '' . If we therefore wish to go to the heart of the Gospel s moral teaching and grasp its profound and unchanging content , we must carefully inquire into the meaning of the question asked by the rich young_man in the Gospel and , even_more , the meaning of Jesus reply , allowing ourselves to be guided by him . Jesus , as a patient and sensitive teacher , answers the young_man by taking him , as it were , by the hand , and leading him step by step to the full truth . '' There -isaia- only one_who_-isaia- good '' Mt : . Jesus says : '' Why do you ask me about what_-isaia-_good ? There -isaia- only one_who_-isaia- good . If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . In the versions of the Evangelists Mark and Luke the question -isaia- phrased in this_way : '' Why do you call me good ? No one_-isaia- good but God alone '' Mk : ; cf . Before answering the question , Jesus wishes the young_man to have a clear idea of why he asked his question . The '' Good Teacher '' points_out to him and to all of us that the answer to the question , '' What good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' can_only be found by turning one s mind_and_heart to the '' One '' who_-isaia- good : '' No one_-isaia- good but God alone '' Mk : ; cf . Only God can answer the question about what_-isaia-_good , because he -isaia- the Good itself . To ask about the good , in fact , ultimately means to turn towards God , the fullness of goodness . Jesus shows_that the young_man s question -isaia- really a religious question , and that the goodness that attracts and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time obliges man_has its source in God , and indeed -isaia- God himself . God alone_-isaia- worthy of being loved '' with all one s heart , and with all one s soul , and with all one s mind '' Mt : . He -isaia-_the_source of man s happiness . Jesus brings the question about morally good action back to its religious foundations , to the acknowledgment of God , who alone_-isaia- goodness , fullness of life , the final end of human activity , and perfect happiness . The Church , instructed by the Teacher s words , believes that_man , made in the image of the Creator , redeemed by the Blood of Christ and made holy by the presence of the Holy Spirit , has as the ultimate purpose of his_life to live '' for the praise of God s glory '' cf . Eph : , striving to make each of his actions reflect the splendour of that glory . '' Know , then , O beautiful soul , that_you are the image of God '' , writes Saint Ambrose . '' Know that_you are the glory of God Cor : . Hear how you_are his glory . The Prophet says : Your knowledge has become too wonderful for me cf . That -isaia- to say , in my work your majesty has become more wonderful ; in the counsels of men your wisdom -isaia- exalted . When I consider myself , such as I -amos- known to you in my secret thoughts and deepest emotions , the mysteries of your knowledge are disclosed to me . Know then , O man , your greatness , and be vigilant '' . What man_-isaia- and what he must do becomes clear as soon as God reveals himself . The Decalogue -isaia- based on these_words : '' I -amos- the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage '' Ex : . In the '' ten words '' of the Covenant with Israel , and in the whole Law , God makes himself known and acknowledged as the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' ; the One who despite man s sin remains the '' model '' for moral action , in accordance_with his command , '' You shall be holy ; for I the Lord your God -amos- holy '' Lev : ; as the One who , faithful to his_love for_man , gives him his Law cf . Ex : and : in order to restore man s original and peaceful harmony_with_the Creator and with all creation , and , what_-isaia- more , to draw him into_his divine_love : '' I will walk among_you , and will be your God , and you shall be my people '' Lev : . The moral_life presents itself as the response due to the many gratuitous initiatives taken by God out of love for_man . It -isaia- a response of love , according to the statement made in Deuteronomy about the fundamental commandment : '' Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God -isaia- one Lord ; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your might . And these_words which I command you this_day shall be upon your heart ; and you shall teach them diligently to your children '' Dt : . Thus the moral_life , caught up in the gratuitousness of God s love , -isaia- called to reflect his glory : '' For the one_who loves God it -isaia- enough to be pleasing to the One whom he loves : for no greater reward should be sought than_that love itself ; charity in fact -isaia- of God in such_a_way_that God himself_-isaia- charity '' . The statement that '' There -isaia- only one_who_-isaia- good '' thus brings us back to the '' first tablet '' of the commandments , which calls us to acknowledge God as the one Lord of all and to worship him alone for his infinite holiness cf . The good -isaia- belonging to God , obeying him , walking humbly with_him in doing justice and in loving kindness cf . Acknowledging the Lord as God -isaia- the very core , the heart of the Law , from which_the particular precepts flow and towards which_they_are ordered . In the morality of the commandments the fact_that the people of Israel belongs to the Lord -isaia- made evident , because God alone_-isaia- the One who_-isaia- good . Such -isaia- the witness of Sacred Scripture , imbued in every_one of its pages with a lively perception of God s absolute holiness : '' Holy , holy , holy -isaia- the Lord of hosts '' Is : . But if God alone_-isaia- the Good , no human effort , not_even the most rigorous observance of the commandments , succeeds in '' fulfilling '' the Law , that_-isaia- , acknowledging the Lord as God and rendering him the worship due to him alone cf . This '' fulfilment '' can come only from a gift of God : the offer of a share in the divine Goodness revealed and communicated in Jesus , the one whom_the rich young_man addresses with the words '' Good Teacher '' Mk : ; Lk : . What the young_man now perhaps only dimly perceives will in the end be fully revealed by Jesus himself in the invitation : '' Come , follow me '' Mt : . '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . Only God can answer the question about the good , because he -isaia- the Good . But God has_already given an answer to this_question : he did so by creating man and ordering him_with wisdom and love to his final end , through the law which_-isaia- inscribed in his_heart cf . Rom : , the '' natural_law '' . The latter '' -isaia- nothing other_than the light of understanding infused in us by God , whereby we understand what must be done and what must be avoided . God gave this light and this_law to man -atti_degli_apostoli- creation '' . He also did so in the history of Israel , particularly in the '' ten words '' , the commandments of Sinai , whereby he brought into existence the people of the Covenant cf . Ex and called them to be his '' own possession among all peoples '' , '' a holy nation '' Ex : , which_would radiate his_holiness to all peoples cf . The gift of the Decalogue was a promise and sign of the New Covenant , in which_the law would be written in a new and definitive way upon the human_heart cf . Jer : , replacing the law of sin which_had disfigured that heart cf . In those days , '' a new heart '' would be given , for in it would dwell '' a new spirit '' , the Spirit of God cf . Consequently , after making the important clarification : '' There -isaia- only one_who_-isaia- good '' , Jesus tells the young_man : '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . In this_way , a close connection -isaia- made between eternal_life and obedience to God s commandments : God s commandments show man the path of life and they lead to it . From the very lips of Jesus , the new Moses , man_-isaia- once_again given the commandments of the Decalogue . Jesus himself definitively confirms them and proposes them to us as the way and condition of salvation . The commandments are linked to a promise . In the Old Covenant the object of the promise was_the possession of a land where_the people would be able to live in freedom and in accordance_with righteousness cf . In the New Covenant the object of the promise -isaia- the '' Kingdom of Heaven '' , as Jesus declares -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the '' Sermon on the Mount '' a sermon which contains the fullest and most complete formulation of the New Law cf . Mt , clearly linked to the Decalogue entrusted by God to Moses on Mount Sinai . This same reality of the Kingdom -isaia- referred to in the expression '' eternal_life '' , which_-isaia- a participation in the very life of God . It -isaia- attained in its perfection only after death , but in faith it -isaia- even_now a light of truth , a source of meaning for life , an inchoate share in the full following of Christ . Indeed , Jesus says to his_disciples after speaking to the rich young_man : '' Every one_who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands , for my name s sake , will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal_life '' Mt : . Jesus answer -isaia-_not_enough for the young man_,_who continues by asking the Teacher about the commandments which_must be kept : '' He said to him , Which ones ? '' Mt : . He asks what he must do in life in order to show that he acknowledges God s holiness . After directing the young_man s gaze towards God , Jesus reminds him of the commandments of the Decalogue regarding one s neighbour : '' Jesus said : You shall_not murder ; You shall_not commit adultery ; You shall_not bear false witness ; Honour your father and mother ; also , You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Mt : . From the context of the conversation , and especially from a comparison of Matthew s text with the parallel passages in Mark and Luke , it -isaia- clear_that Jesus does_not intend to list each_and_every one of the commandments required in order to '' enter_into life '' , but_rather wishes to draw the young_man s attention to the '' centrality '' of the Decalogue with_regard to every_other precept , inasmuch as it -isaia- the interpretation of what_the words '' I -amos- the Lord your God '' mean for_man . Nevertheless we cannot_fail to notice which commandments of the Law the Lord recalls to the young_man . They are_some of the commandments belonging to the so called '' second tablet '' of the Decalogue , the summary cf . Rom : and foundation of which_-isaia- the commandment of love of neighbour : '' You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Mt : ; cf . In this commandment we find a precise expression of the singular dignity_of_the_human_person , '' the only creature that God has wanted for its_own sake '' . The different commandments of the Decalogue are really only so many reflections of the one commandment about the good of the person , -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the many_different goods which characterize his identity as a spiritual and bodily being in relationship_with God , with_his neighbour and with the material world . As we read in the Catechism of the Catholic Church , '' the Ten Commandments are part of God s Revelation . At the same_time , they teach us man s true humanity . They shed light on the essential duties , and so indirectly on the fundamental rights , inherent in the nature of the human_person '' . The commandments of which Jesus reminds the young_man are meant to safeguard the good of the person , the image of God , by protecting his goods . '' You shall_not murder ; You shall_not commit adultery ; You shall_not steal ; You shall_not bear false witness '' are moral rules formulated in terms of prohibitions . These negative precepts express with particular force the ever urgent_need to protect human_life , the communion of persons in marriage , private_property , truthfulness and people s good name . The commandments thus represent the basic condition_for love of neighbour ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_are the proof of that_love . They are the first necessary step on the journey towards freedom , its starting point . '' The beginning of freedom '' , Saint Augustine writes , '' -isaia- to be free_from crimes . such as murder , adultery , fornication , theft , fraud , sacrilege and so forth . When once one_-isaia- without these crimes and every Christian should be without them , one begins to lift up one s head towards freedom . But this_-isaia- only the beginning of freedom , not perfect freedom . This certainly does_not_mean that Christ wishes to put the love of neighbour higher than , or even to set it apart_from , the love of God . This -isaia- evident from his conversation with the teacher of the Law , who asked him a question very much like the one asked by the young_man . Jesus refers him to the two commandments of love of God and love of neighbour cf . Lk : , and reminds him that_only by observing them will he have eternal_life : '' Do this , and you will live '' Lk : . Nonetheless it -isaia- significant that_it_-isaia- precisely_the second of these commandments which arouses the curiosity of the teacher of the Law , who asks him : '' And who_-isaia- my neighbour ? '' Lk : . The Teacher replies with the parable of the Good Samaritan , which_-isaia- critical for fully understanding the commandment of love of neighbour cf . These two commandments , on which '' depend all the Law and the Prophets '' Mt : , are profoundly connected and mutually related . Their inseparable unity -isaia- attested to by Christ in his_words and by his_very life : his_mission culminates in the Cross of our Redemption cf . Jn : , the sign of his indivisible love for the Father and for_humanity cf . Both the Old and the New Testaments explicitly affirm that without love of neighbour , made concrete in keeping the commandments , genuine love for God -isaia- not_possible . Saint John makes_the point with extraordinary forcefulness : '' If anyone says , I love God , and hates his_brother , he -isaia- a liar ; for he who_does_not love his_brother whom he has seen , cannot love God whom he has not seen '' Jn : . The Evangelist echoes the moral preaching of Christ , expressed in a wonderful and unambiguous way in the parable of the Good Samaritan cf . Lk : and in his_words about the final judgment cf . In the '' Sermon on the Mount '' , the magna charta of Gospel morality , Jesus says : '' Do not think_that I have come to abolish the Law and the Prophets ; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them '' Mt : . Christ -isaia- the key to the Scriptures : '' You search the Scriptures . ; and it -isaia- they that bear_witness to me '' Jn : . Christ -isaia- the centre of the economy of salvation , the recapitulation of the Old and New Testaments , of the promises of the Law and of their fulfilment in the Gospel ; he -isaia- the living and eternal link between_the Old and the New Covenants . Commenting on Paul s statement that '' Christ -isaia- the end of the law '' Rom : , Saint Ambrose writes : '' end not in the sense of a deficiency , but in the sense of the fullness of the Law : a fullness which_-isaia- achieved in Christ plenitudo legis in Christo -ester- , since he came not to abolish the Law but to bring it to fulfilment . In the same_way that_there_-isaia- an Old Testament , but all truth_-isaia- in the New Testament , so it -isaia- for the Law : what was_given through Moses -isaia- a figure of the true law . Therefore , the Mosaic Law -isaia- an image of the truth '' . Jesus brings God s commandments to fulfilment , particularly the commandment of love of neighbour , by interiorizing their demands and by bringing out_their fullest meaning . Love of neighbour springs from a loving heart which , precisely_because it loves , -isaia- ready to live out the loftiest challenges . Jesus shows_that the commandments must_not be understood as a minimum limit not to be gone beyond , but_rather as a path involving a moral and spiritual journey towards perfection , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of which_-isaia- love cf . Thus the commandment '' You shall_not murder '' becomes a call to an attentive love_which protects and promotes the life of one s neighbour . The precept prohibiting adultery becomes an invitation to a pure way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- others , capable of respecting the spousal meaning of the body : '' You have heard that_it_was said to the men of old , You shall_not kill ; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment . But I say to you that_every one_who_-isaia- angry with his_brother shall be liable to judgment . You have heard that_it_was said , You shall_not commit adultery . But I say to you that_every one_who looks -atti_degli_apostoli- a woman lustfully has_already committed adultery with_her in his_heart '' Mt : , . Jesus himself_-isaia- the living '' fulfilment '' of the Law inasmuch as he fulfils its authentic meaning by the total gift of himself : he himself becomes a living and personal Law , who invites people to follow_him ; through the Spirit , he gives the grace to share his own_life and love and provides the strength to bear_witness to that_love in personal choices and actions cf . '' If you wish to be perfect '' Mt : . The answer he receives about the commandments does_not satisfy the young man_,_who asks Jesus a further question . '' I have kept all these ; what do I still lack ? '' Mt : . It -isaia- not easy to say with a clear conscience '' I have kept all these '' , if one_has any understanding of the real meaning of the demands contained in God s Law . And yet , even_though he -isaia- able to make_this reply , even_though he has followed the moral ideal seriously and generously from childhood , the rich young_man knows that_he_-isaia- still far from the goal : before the person of Jesus he realizes that_he_-isaia- still lacking something . It -isaia-_his awareness of this insufficiency that Jesus addresses in his final answer . Conscious of the young_man s yearning for something greater , which_would transcend a legalistic interpretation of the commandments , the Good Teacher invites him to enter upon the path of perfection : '' If you wish to be perfect , go , sell your possessions and give the money to the poor , and you will_have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me '' Mt : . Like the earlier part of Jesus answer , this part too must be read and interpreted in the context of the whole moral message of the Gospel , and in particular in the context of the Sermon on the Mount , the Beatitudes cf . Mt : , the first of which_-isaia- precisely_the Beatitude of the poor , the '' poor in spirit '' as Saint Matthew makes clear Mt : , the humble . In this_sense it can_be_said that the Beatitudes are_also relevant to the answer given by Jesus to the young_man s question : '' What good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' . Indeed , each of the Beatitudes promises , from a particular viewpoint , that_very '' good '' which opens man up to eternal_life , and indeed -isaia- eternal_life . The Beatitudes are_not specifically concerned_with certain particular rules of behaviour . Rather , they speak of basic attitudes and dispositions in life and therefore they_do_not coincide exactly with the commandments . On the other_hand , there_-isaia- no separation or opposition between_the Beatitudes and the commandments : both refer to the good , to eternal_life . The Sermon on the Mount begins with the proclamation of the Beatitudes , but_also refers to the commandments cf . At the same_time , the Sermon on the Mount demonstrates the openness of the commandments and their orientation towards_the horizon of the perfection proper to the Beatitudes . These latter are above all promises , from which_there also indirectly flow normative indications for the moral_life . In their originality and profundity they_are a sort of self portrait of Christ , and for this_very reason are invitations to discipleship and to communion of life with Christ . We do not know_how clearly_the young_man in the Gospel understood the profound and challenging import of Jesus first reply : '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' . But it -isaia- certain_that the young_man s commitment to respect all the moral demands of the commandments represents the absolutely essential ground in which_the desire_for perfection can take root and mature , the desire , that_-isaia- , for the meaning of the commandments to be completely fulfilled in following Christ . Jesus conversation with the young_man helps us to grasp the conditions for the moral growth of man_,_who has been_called to perfection : the young_man , having observed all the commandments , shows that_he_-isaia- incapable of taking the next step by himself alone . To do so requires mature human_freedom '' If you wish to be perfect '' and God s gift of grace '' Come , follow me '' . Perfection demands_that maturity in self_giving to which human freedom_-isaia- called . Jesus points_out to the young_man that the commandments are the first and indispensable condition_for having eternal_life ; on the other_hand , for the young_man to give up all he possesses and to follow_the Lord -isaia- presented as an invitation : '' If you wish . These words of Jesus reveal the particular dynamic of freedom s growth towards maturity , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they bear_witness to the fundamental relationship_between freedom and divine_law . Human freedom and God s law are_not in opposition ; on the contrary , they appeal one to the other . The follower of Christ knows that_his vocation -isaia- to freedom . '' You were called to freedom , brethren '' Gal : , proclaims_the Apostle Paul with_joy and pride . But he immediately adds : '' only do not use your freedom as an opportunity_for the flesh , but through love be servants of one_another '' ibid . The firmness with_which_the Apostle opposes those who_believe that_they_are justified by the Law has nothing to do with_man s '' liberation '' from precepts . On the contrary , the latter are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the practice of love : '' For he who loves his neighbour has fulfilled the Law . The commandments , You shall_not commit adultery ; You shall_not murder ; You shall_not steal ; You shall_not covet , and any_other commandment , are summed up in this sentence , You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Rom : . Saint Augustine , after speaking of the observance of the commandments as being a kind of incipient , imperfect freedom , goes on to say : '' Why , someone will ask , -isaia- it not_yet perfect ? Because I see in my members another law -atti_degli_apostoli- war with the law of my reason . In part freedom , in part slavery : not_yet complete freedom , not_yet pure , not_yet whole , because we are_not yet in eternity . In part we retain our weakness and in part we have attained freedom . All our sins were destroyed in Baptism , but does it follow that no weakness remained after iniquity was destroyed ? Had none remained , we would live without sin in this_life . But who_would dare to say this except someone who_-isaia- proud , someone unworthy of the mercy of our deliverer ? . Therefore , since some weakness has remained in us , I dare to say that to the extent to which we serve God we are free , while to the extent_that we follow_the law of sin , we are_still slaves '' . Those who_live '' by the flesh '' experience God s law as a burden , and indeed as a denial or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a restriction of their_own freedom . On the other_hand , those_who_are impelled by love and '' walk by the Spirit '' Gal : , and who desire to serve others , find in God s Law the fundamental and necessary way_in_which to practise love as something freely chosen and freely lived out . Indeed , they feel an interior urge a genuine '' necessity '' and no longer a form of coercion not to stop -atti_degli_apostoli- the minimum demands of the Law , but to live them in their '' fullness '' . This -isaia- a still uncertain and fragile journey as long as we are on earth , but_it_-isaia- one made possible by grace , which enables us to possess the full freedom of the children of God cf . Rom : and thus to live our moral_life in a way worthy of our sublime vocation as '' sons in the Son '' . This vocation to perfect love_-isaia- not restricted to a small group of individuals . The invitation , '' go , sell your possessions and give the money to the poor '' , and the promise '' you will_have treasure in heaven '' , are meant for everyone , because_they bring out the full meaning of the commandment of love for neighbour , just as the invitation which follows , '' Come , follow me '' , -isaia- the new , specific form of the commandment of love of God . Both the commandments and Jesus invitation to the rich young_man stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a single and indivisible charity , which spontaneously tends towards that perfection whose measure -isaia- God alone : '' You , therefore , must be perfect , as your heavenly Father -isaia- perfect '' Mt : . In the Gospel of Luke , Jesus makes even clearer the meaning of this perfection : '' Be merciful , even as your Father -isaia- merciful '' Lk : . The way and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the content of this perfection consist in the following of Jesus , sequela Christi , once one has_given up one_s_own wealth and very self . This -isaia- precisely_the conclusion of Jesus conversation with the young_man : '' Come , follow me '' Mt : . It -isaia- an invitation the marvellous grandeur of which_will be fully perceived by the disciples after Christ s Resurrection , when_the Holy Spirit leads them to all truth cf . It -isaia- Jesus himself who takes the initiative and calls people to follow_him . His call -isaia- addressed first to those_to_whom he entrusts a particular mission , beginning with the Twelve ; but_it_-isaia- also clear_that every believer -isaia- called to be a follower of Christ cf . Following Christ -isaia- thus_the essential and primordial foundation of Christian morality : just as the people of Israel followed God who led them through the desert towards_the Promised Land cf . Ex : , so every disciple must follow Jesus , towards whom he -isaia- drawn by the Father himself cf . This -isaia- not a matter only of disposing oneself to hear a teaching and obediently accepting a commandment . More radically , it involves holding fast to the very person of Jesus , partaking of his_life and his destiny , sharing in his free and loving obedience to the will of the Father . By responding in faith and following the one_who_-isaia- Incarnate Wisdom , the disciple of Jesus truly becomes a disciple of God cf . Jesus -isaia- indeed the light_of_the_world , the light of life cf . He -isaia- the shepherd who leads his sheep and feeds them cf . Jn : ; he -isaia-_the_way , and the truth , and the life cf . It -isaia- Jesus who leads to the Father , so much so that to see him , the Son , -isaia- to see the Father cf . And thus to imitate the Son , '' the image of the invisible God '' Col : , means to imitate the Father . Jesus asks us to follow_him and to imitate him along the path of love , a love which_gives itself completely to the brethren out of love for God : '' This -isaia- my commandment , that_you love one_another as I have loved you '' Jn : . The word '' as '' requires imitation of Jesus and of his_love , of which_the washing of feet -isaia- a sign : '' If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one_another s feet . For I have_given you an example , that you_should do as I have_done to you '' Jn : . Jesus way of acting and his_words , his deeds and his precepts constitute the moral rule of Christian life . Indeed , his actions , and in particular his Passion and Death on the Cross , are the living revelation of his_love for the Father and for others . This -isaia- exactly the love_that Jesus wishes to be imitated by all who follow_him . It -isaia- the '' new '' commandment : '' A new commandment I give to you , that_you love one_another ; even as I have loved you , that_you also love one_another . By this all men will know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another '' Jn : . The word '' as '' also indicates the degree of Jesus love , and of the love with_which his_disciples are_called to love one_another . After saying : '' This -isaia- my commandment , that_you love one_another as I have loved you '' Jn : , Jesus continues with words_which indicate the sacrificial gift of his_life on the Cross , as the witness to a love '' to the end '' Jn : : '' Greater love has no man than_this , that a man lay_down his_life for his friends '' Jn : . As he calls the young_man to follow_him along the way of perfection , Jesus asks him to be perfect in the command of love , in '' his '' commandment : to become part of the unfolding of his complete giving , to imitate and rekindle the very love of the '' Good '' Teacher , the one_who loved '' to the end '' . This -isaia- what Jesus asks of everyone who wishes to follow_him : '' If any man would come after me , let_him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me '' Mt : . Following Christ -isaia- not an outward imitation , since it touches man -atti_degli_apostoli- the very depths of his being . Being a follower of Christ means becoming conformed to him_who became a servant even to giving himself on the Cross cf . Christ dwells by faith in the heart of the believer cf . Eph : , and thus_the disciple -isaia- conformed to the Lord . This -isaia- the effect of grace , of the active presence of the Holy Spirit in us . Having become one_with Christ , the Christian becomes a member of his Body , which_-isaia- the Church cf . By the work of the Spirit , Baptism radically configures the faithful to Christ in the Paschal Mystery of death_and_resurrection ; it '' clothes him '' in Christ cf . Gal : : '' Let us rejoice and give thanks '' , exclaims Saint Augustine speaking to the baptized , '' for we have_become not_only Christians , but Christ . Marvel and rejoice : we have_become Christ ! '' . Having died to sin , those_who_are baptized receive new_life cf . Rom : : alive for God in Christ Jesus , they_are_called to walk by the Spirit and to manifest the Spirit s fruits in their_lives cf . Sharing in the Eucharist , the sacrament of the New Covenant cf . Cor : , -isaia- the culmination of our assimilation to Christ , the source of '' eternal_life '' cf . Jn : , the source and power of that complete gift_of_self , which Jesus according to the testimony handed on by Paul commands us to commemorate in liturgy and in life : '' As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim_the Lord s death until he comes '' Cor : . '' With God all things_are possible '' Mt : . The conclusion of Jesus conversation with the rich young_man -isaia-_very poignant : '' When the young_man heard this , he went away sorrowful , for he had many possessions '' Mt : . Not only the rich man but the disciples themselves are taken aback by Jesus call to discipleship , the demands of which transcend human aspirations and abilities : '' When the disciples heard this , they_were greatly astounded and said , '' Then who_can be saved ? '' Mt : . But the Master refers them to God s power : '' With men this_-isaia- impossible , but_with God all things_are possible '' Mt : . In the same chapter of Matthew s Gospel : , Jesus , interpreting the Mosaic Law on marriage , rejects the right to divorce , appealing to a '' beginning '' more fundamental and more authoritative than the Law of Moses : God s original plan_for mankind , a plan which_man after sin has no longer been_able to live up to : '' For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives , but_from the beginning it was_not so '' Mt : . Jesus appeal to the '' beginning '' dismays the disciples , who remark : '' If such_-isaia- the case of a man with_his wife , it -isaia- not expedient to marry '' Mt : . And Jesus , referring specifically to the charism of celibacy '' for the Kingdom of Heaven '' Mt : , but stating a general rule , indicates the new and surprising possibility opened up to man by God s grace . '' He said to them : Not everyone can accept this saying , but_only those_to_whom it -isaia- given '' Mt : . To imitate and live out the love of Christ -isaia- not_possible for_man by his_own strength alone . He becomes capable of this_love only by virtue of a gift received . As the Lord Jesus receives the love of his Father , so he in turn freely communicates that_love to his_disciples : '' As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you ; abide in my love '' Jn : . Christ s gift -isaia-_his Spirit , whose first '' fruit '' cf . Gal : -isaia- charity : '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit which has_been_given to us '' Rom : . Saint Augustine asks : '' Does love bring_about the keeping of the commandments , or does the keeping of the commandments bring_about love ? '' And he answers : '' But who_can doubt_that love comes first ? For the one who_does_not love has no reason_for keeping the commandments '' . '' The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free_from the law of sin and death '' Rom : . With these_words the Apostle Paul invites us to consider in the perspective of the history_of_salvation , which reaches its fulfilment in Christ , the relationship_between_the Old Law and grace the New Law . He recognizes the pedagogic function of the Law , which , by enabling sinful man to take stock of his_own powerlessness and by stripping him of the presumption of his self sufficiency , leads him to ask for and to receive '' life in the Spirit '' . Only in this_new life_-isaia- it possible to carry_out God s commandments . Indeed , it -isaia- through_faith in Christ that_we_have been_made righteous cf . Rom : : the '' righteousness '' which_the Law demands , but_-isaia- unable to give , -isaia- found by every believer to be revealed and granted by the Lord Jesus . Once again it -isaia- Saint Augustine who admirably sums up this Pauline dialectic of law and grace : '' The law was_given that grace might be sought ; and grace was_given , that the law might be fulfilled '' . Love and life according to the Gospel cannot be thought of first_and_foremost as a kind of precept , because what_they demand -isaia- beyond man s abilities . They are possible only as the result of a gift of God who heals , restores and transforms the human_heart by his_grace : '' For the law was_given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ '' Jn : . The promise of eternal_life -isaia- thus linked to the gift of grace , and the gift of the Spirit which we have_received -isaia- even_now the '' guarantee of our inheritance '' Eph : . And so we find revealed the authentic and original aspect of the commandment of love and of the perfection to which_it_-isaia- ordered : we are speaking of a possibility opened up to man exclusively by grace , by the gift of God , by his_love . On the other_hand , precisely_the awareness of having received_the gift , of possessing in Jesus Christ the love of God , generates and sustains the free response of a full love for God and the brethren , as the Apostle John insistently reminds us in his_first Letter : '' Beloved , let us love one_another ; for love_-isaia- of God and knows God . He who_does_not love does_not know God ; for God -isaia- love . Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one_another . We love , because he first loved us '' Jn : , , . This inseparable connection_between the Lord s grace and human_freedom , between gift and task , has_been expressed in simple yet profound words by Saint Augustine in his prayer : '' Da quod iubes et iube quod vis '' grant what_you command and command what_you will . The gift does_not lessen but reinforces the moral demands of love : '' This -isaia-_his commandment , that_we_should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one_another just as he has commanded us '' Jn : . One can '' abide '' in love only by keeping the commandments , as Jesus states : '' If you keep my commandments , you will abide in my love , just as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his_love '' Jn : . Going to the heart of the moral message of Jesus and the preaching of the Apostles , and summing up in a remarkable way the great tradition of the Fathers of the East and West , and of Saint Augustine in particular , Saint Thomas was able to write that the New Law -isaia- the grace of the Holy Spirit given through_faith in Christ . The external precepts also mentioned in the Gospel dispose one for_this grace or produce its effects in one s life . Indeed , the New Law -isaia- not content to say what must be done , but_also gives the power to '' do what_-isaia- true '' cf . Saint John Chrysostom likewise observed that the New Law was promulgated -atti_degli_apostoli- the descent of the Holy Spirit from heaven on the day of Pentecost , and that the Apostles '' did_not come down from the mountain carrying , like Moses , tablets of stone in their hands ; but_they came down carrying the Holy Spirit in their_hearts . having become by his_grace a living law , a living book '' . '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . Jesus conversation with the rich young_man continues , in a sense , in every period of history , including our_own . The question : '' Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' arises in the heart of every_individual , and it -isaia- Christ alone who_-isaia- capable of giving the full and definitive answer . The Teacher who expounds God s commandments , who invites others to follow_him and gives the grace for a new_life , -isaia- always present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our midst , as he himself promised : '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . Christ s relevance for people of all times -isaia- shown forth in his_body , which_-isaia- the Church . For this_reason_the Lord promised his_disciples the Holy Spirit , who_would '' bring to their remembrance '' and teach them to understand his commandments cf . Jn : , and who_would be the principle and constant source of a new_life in the world cf . The moral prescriptions which God imparted in the Old Covenant , and which attained their perfection in the New and Eternal Covenant in the very person of the Son of God made man , must be faithfully kept and continually put into_practice in the various different_cultures throughout_the course of history . The task of interpreting these prescriptions was entrusted by Jesus to the Apostles and to their successors , with the special assistance of the Spirit of truth : '' He who hears you hears me '' Lk : . By the light and the strength of this Spirit the Apostles carried_out their_mission of preaching the Gospel and of pointing out the '' way '' of the Lord cf . Acts : , teaching above all how to follow and imitate Christ : '' For to me to live -isaia- Christ '' Phil : . In the moral catechesis of the Apostles , besides exhortations and directions connected to specific historical and cultural situations , we find an ethical teaching with precise rules of behaviour . This -isaia- seen in their Letters , which contain the interpretation , made under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , of the Lord s precepts as they_are to be lived in different cultural circumstances cf . Rom ; Cor ; Gal ; Eph ; Col ; Pt and Jas . From the Church s beginnings , the Apostles , by virtue of their pastoral responsibility to preach the Gospel , were vigilant over the right conduct of Christians , just as they_were vigilant for the purity of the faith and the handing down of the divine gifts in the sacraments . The first Christians , coming both from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles , differed from the pagans not_only in their_faith and their liturgy but_also in the witness of their moral conduct , which_was inspired by the New Law . The Church -isaia-_in_fact a communion both of faith and of life ; her rule of life_-isaia- '' faith working through love '' Gal : . No damage must be done to the harmony between_faith and life : the unity of the Church -isaia- damaged not_only by Christians who reject or distort the truths of faith but_also by those_who disregard the moral obligations to which they_are_called by the Gospel cf . The Apostles decisively rejected any separation between_the commitment of the heart and the actions which express or prove it cf . And ever since Apostolic times the Church s Pastors have unambiguously condemned the behaviour of those_who fostered division by their teaching or by their actions . Within the unity of the Church , promoting and preserving the faith and the moral life_-isaia- the task entrusted by Jesus to the Apostles cf . Mt : , a task which continues in the ministry of their successors . This -isaia- apparent from the living Tradition , whereby as the Second Vatican Council teaches '' the Church , in her teaching , life and worship , perpetuates and hands on to every generation all that she_-isaia- and all that_she believes . This Tradition which_comes_from the Apostles , progresses in the Church under the assistance of the Holy Spirit '' . In the Holy Spirit , the Church receives and hands down the Scripture as the witness to the '' great things '' which God has done in history cf . Lk : ; she professes by the lips of her Fathers and Doctors the truth of the Word made_flesh , puts his precepts and love into_practice in the lives of her Saints and in the sacrifice of her Martyrs , and celebrates her hope in him in the Liturgy . By this_same Tradition Christians receive '' the living voice of the Gospel '' , as the faithful expression of God s wisdom and will . Within Tradition , the authentic interpretation of the Lord s law develops , with the help of the Holy Spirit . The same Spirit who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the Revelation of Jesus commandments and teachings guarantees that_they_will be reverently preserved , faithfully expounded and correctly applied in different times and places . This constant '' putting into_practice '' of the commandments -isaia- the sign and fruit of a deeper insight into Revelation and of an understanding in the light_of_faith of new historical and cultural situations . Nevertheless , it can_only confirm the permanent validity of Revelation and follow in the line of the interpretation given to it by the great Tradition of the Church s teaching and life , as witnessed by the teaching of the Fathers , the lives of the Saints , the Church s Liturgy and the teaching of the Magisterium . In particular , as the Council affirms , '' the task of authentically interpreting the word of God , whether in its written form or in that of Tradition , has_been entrusted only to those charged with the Church s living Magisterium , whose authority_-isaia- exercised in the name of Jesus Christ '' . The Church , in her_life and teaching , -isaia- thus revealed as '' the pillar and bulwark of the truth '' Tim : , including the truth regarding moral action . Indeed , '' the Church has the right always and everywhere to proclaim moral principles , even in respect of the social_order , and to make judgments about any human matter in so far as this_-isaia- required by fundamental human_rights or the salvation_of_souls '' . Precisely on the questions frequently debated in moral theology today and with_regard to which new tendencies and theories have developed , the Magisterium , in fidelity to Jesus Christ and in continuity with the Church s tradition , senses more urgently the duty to offer its_own discernment and teaching , in order to help man in his journey towards truth and freedom . CHAPTER II '' DO NOT BE CONFORMED TO THIS WORLD '' Rom : The Church and the discernment of certain tendencies in present_day moral theology Teaching what befits sound doctrine cf . Our meditation on the dialogue_between Jesus and the rich young_man has enabled us to bring together the essential elements of Revelation in the Old and New Testament with_regard to moral action . These are : the subordination of man and his activity to God , the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' ; the relationship clearly indicated in the divine commandments , between_the moral good of human acts and eternal_life ; Christian discipleship , which opens up before man the perspective of perfect love ; and finally the gift of the Holy Spirit , source and means of the moral_life of the '' new creation '' cf . In her reflection on morality , the Church has_always kept in mind the words of Jesus to the rich young_man . Indeed , Sacred Scripture remains the living and fruitful source of the Church s moral doctrine ; as the Second Vatican Council recalled , the Gospel -isaia- '' the source of all saving truth and moral teaching '' . The Church has faithfully preserved what_the word of God teaches , not_only about truths_which must be believed but_also about moral action , action pleasing to God cf . Th : ; she_has achieved a doctrinal development analogous to that_which has taken_place in the realm of the truths of faith . Assisted by the Holy Spirit who leads her into all the truth cf . Jn : , the Church has not ceased , nor_can she ever cease , to contemplate the '' mystery of the Word Incarnate '' , in whom '' light -isaia- shed on the mystery of man '' . The Church s moral reflection , always conducted in the light of Christ , the '' Good Teacher '' , has_also developed in the specific form of the theological science called '' moral theology '' , a science which accepts and examines Divine Revelation while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time responding to the demands of human_reason . Moral theology -isaia- a reflection concerned_with '' morality '' , with the good and the evil of human acts and of the person_who performs them ; in this_sense it -isaia- accessible to all people . But it -isaia-_also '' theology '' , inasmuch as it acknowledges that the origin and end of moral action are_found in the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' and who , by giving himself to man in Christ , offers him the happiness of divine_life . The Second Vatican Council invited scholars to take '' special_care for the renewal of moral theology '' , in such_a_way_that '' its scientific presentation , increasingly based on the teaching of Scripture , will cast light on the exalted vocation of the faithful in Christ and on their obligation to bear_fruit in charity for the life of the world '' . The Council also encouraged theologians , '' while respecting the methods and requirements of theological science , to look for a more appropriate way of communicating doctrine to the people of their time ; since there_-isaia- a difference between_the deposit or the truths of faith and the manner in which_they_are expressed , keeping the same meaning and the same judgment '' . This led to a further invitation , one extended to all the faithful , but addressed to theologians in particular : '' The faithful should live in the closest contact_with others of their time , and should work_for a perfect understanding of their modes of thought and feelings as expressed in their culture '' . The work of many theologians who found support in the Council s encouragement has_already borne fruit in interesting and helpful reflections about the truths of faith to be believed and applied in life , reflections offered in a form better suited to the sensitivities and questions of our contemporaries . The Church , and particularly the Bishops , to whom Jesus Christ primarily entrusted the ministry of teaching , are deeply appreciative of this_work , and encourage theologians to continue their_efforts , inspired by that profound and authentic '' fear of the Lord , which_-isaia- the beginning of wisdom '' cf . At the same_time , however , within_the context of the theological debates which followed the Council , there have developed certain interpretations of Christian morality which_are not consistent with '' sound teaching '' Tim : . Certainly the Church s Magisterium does_not intend to impose upon the faithful any particular theological system , still less a philosophical one . Nevertheless , in order to '' reverently preserve and faithfully expound '' the word of God , the Magisterium has the duty to state that_some trends of theological thinking and certain philosophical affirmations are incompatible with revealed_truth . In addressing this Encyclical to you , my Brother Bishops , it -isaia- my intention to state the principles necessary_for discerning what_-isaia- contrary to '' sound doctrine '' , drawing attention to those elements of the Church s moral teaching which today appear particularly exposed to error , ambiguity or neglect . Yet these_are the very elements on which_there depends '' the answer to the obscure riddles of the human condition which today also , as in the past , profoundly disturb the human_heart . What -isaia-_man ? What -isaia- the meaning and purpose of our life ? What -isaia- good and what_-isaia- sin ? What origin and purpose do sufferings have ? What -isaia-_the_way to attaining true happiness ? What are death , judgment and retribution after death ? Lastly , what_-isaia- that final , unutterable mystery which embraces our_lives and from which we take our origin and towards which we tend ? '' . These and other questions , such as : what_-isaia- freedom and what_-isaia- its relationship to the truth contained in God s law ? what_-isaia- the role of conscience in man s moral development ? how do we determine , in accordance_with_the truth_about the good , the specific rights_and_duties of the human_person ? can all be summed up in the fundamental question which_the young_man in the Gospel put to Jesus : '' Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' Because the Church has_been sent by Jesus to preach the Gospel and to '' make disciples of all nations . , teaching them to observe all '' that_he_has commanded cf . Mt : , she today once_more puts forward the Master s reply , a reply that possesses a light and a power capable of answering even the most controversial and complex questions . This light and power also impel the Church constantly to carry_out not_only her dogmatic but_also her moral reflection within an interdisciplinary context , which -isaia-_especially necessary in facing new issues . It -isaia- in the same light and power that the Church s Magisterium continues to carry_out its task of discernment , accepting and living out the admonition addressed by the Apostle Paul to Timothy : '' I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who_-isaia- to judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his_kingdom : preach the word , be urgent in season and out of season , convince , rebuke , and exhort , be unfailing in patience and in teaching . For the time will come when people will_not endure sound teaching , but having itching ears they_will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their_own likings , and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths . As for you , always be steady , endure suffering , do the work of an evangelist , fulfil your ministry '' Tim : ; cf . '' You will know_the truth , and the truth will_make you free '' Jn : . The human issues most frequently debated and differently resolved in contemporary moral reflection are all closely related , albeit in various_ways , to a crucial issue : human_freedom . Certainly people today have a particularly strong sense of freedom . As the Council s Declaration on Religious Freedom Dignitatis Humanae had_already observed , '' the dignity_of_the_human_person -isaia- a concern of which people of our_time are becoming increasingly more aware '' . Hence the insistent demand_that people be permitted to '' enjoy_the use of their_own responsible judgment and freedom , and decide on their actions on grounds of duty and conscience , without external pressure or coercion '' . In particular , the right to religious_freedom and to respect_for conscience on its journey towards_the truth_-isaia- increasingly perceived as the foundation of the cumulative rights of the person . This heightened sense of the dignity_of_the_human_person and of his or her uniqueness , and of the respect due to the journey of conscience , certainly represents one of the positive achievements of modern culture . This perception , authentic as it -isaia- , has_been expressed in a number of more_or_less adequate ways , some of which however diverge from the truth_about man as a creature and the image of God , and thus need to be corrected and purified in the light_of_faith . Certain currents of modern thought have gone so far as to exalt freedom to such an extent_that it becomes an absolute , which_would then be the source of values . This -isaia- the direction taken by doctrines which_have lost the sense of the transcendent or which_are explicitly atheist . The individual conscience -isaia- accorded the status of a supreme tribunal of moral judgment which hands down categorical and infallible decisions about good_and_evil . To the affirmation that_one has a duty to follow one s conscience -isaia- unduly added the affirmation that_one s moral judgment -isaia- true merely by the fact_that it has its origin in the conscience . But in this_way the inescapable claims of truth disappear , yielding their place to a criterion of sincerity , authenticity and '' being -atti_degli_apostoli- peace with oneself '' , so much so that_some have come to adopt a radically subjectivistic conception of moral judgment . As -isaia- immediately evident , the crisis of truth_-isaia- not unconnected with this development . Once the idea of a universal truth_about the good , knowable by human_reason , -isaia- lost , inevitably the notion of conscience also changes . Conscience -isaia-_no_longer considered in its primordial reality as an act of a person s intelligence , the function of which_-isaia- to apply the universal knowledge of the good in a specific situation and thus to express a judgment about the right conduct to be chosen here and now . Instead , there_-isaia- a tendency to grant to the individual conscience the prerogative of independently determining the criteria of good_and_evil and then acting accordingly . Such an outlook -isaia- quite congenial to an individualist ethic , wherein each_individual -isaia- faced_with his_own truth , different from the truth of others . Taken to its extreme consequences , this individualism leads to a denial of the very idea of human_nature . These different notions are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of currents of thought which posit a radical opposition between moral_law and conscience , and between nature and freedom . Side by side with its exaltation of freedom , yet oddly in contrast with it , modern culture radically questions the very existence of this freedom . A number of disciplines , grouped under the name of the '' behavioural sciences '' , have rightly drawn attention to the many kinds of psychological and social conditioning which influence the exercise of human_freedom . Knowledge of these conditionings and the study they have_received represent important achievements which_have found application in various areas , for example in pedagogy or the administration of justice . But some people , going beyond_the conclusions which_can be legitimately drawn_from these observations , have come to question or even deny the very reality of human_freedom . Mention should_also be made here of theories which misuse scientific_research about the human_person . Arguing from the great variety of customs , behaviour patterns and institutions present in humanity , these theories end up , if not_with an outright denial of universal human values , -atti_degli_apostoli- least with a relativistic conception of morality . '' Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' . The question of morality , to which Christ provides the answer , cannot prescind from the issue of freedom . Indeed , it considers that issue central , for there_can be no morality without freedom : '' It -isaia- only in freedom that_man can turn to what_-isaia-_good '' . But what sort of freedom ? The Council , considering our contemporaries who '' highly regard '' freedom and '' assiduously pursue '' it , but who '' often cultivate it in wrong ways as a licence to do anything they please , even evil '' , speaks of '' genuine '' freedom : '' Genuine freedom_-isaia- an outstanding manifestation of the divine image in man . For God willed to leave man '' in the power of his_own counsel '' cf . Sir : , so that he would seek his Creator of his_own accord and would freely arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- full and blessed perfection by cleaving to God '' . Although each_individual has a right to be respected in his_own journey in search of the truth , there exists a prior moral obligation , and a grave one -atti_degli_apostoli- that , to seek the truth and to adhere to it once it -isaia- known . As Cardinal John Henry Newman , that outstanding defender of the rights of conscience , forcefully put it : '' Conscience has rights because it has duties '' . Certain tendencies in contemporary moral theology , under the influence of the currents of subjectivism and individualism just mentioned , involve novel interpretations of the relationship of freedom to the moral_law , human_nature and conscience , and propose novel criteria for the moral evaluation of acts . Despite their variety , these tendencies are_-atti_degli_apostoli- one in lessening or even denying the dependence of freedom on truth . If we wish to undertake a critical discernment of these tendencies a discernment capable of acknowledging what_-isaia- legitimate , useful and of value in them , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time pointing out_their ambiguities , dangers and errors we must examine them in the light of the fundamental dependence of freedom upon truth , a dependence which_has found its clearest and most authoritative expression in the words of Christ : '' You will know_the truth , and the truth will set you free '' Jn : . Freedom and Law '' Of the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil you shall_not eat '' Gen : . In the Book of Genesis we read : '' The Lord God commanded the man , saying , You may eat freely of every tree of the garden ; but of the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil you shall_not eat , for in the day that_you eat of it you shall die '' Gen : . With this imagery , Revelation teaches_that the power to decide what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil does_not belong to man , but to God alone . The man_-isaia- certainly free , inasmuch as he can understand and accept God s commands . And he possesses an extremely far reaching freedom , since he can eat '' of every tree of the garden '' . But his freedom_-isaia- not unlimited : it must halt before the '' tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil '' , for it -isaia- called to accept the moral_law given by God . In fact , human_freedom finds_its authentic and complete fulfilment precisely in the acceptance of that law . God , who alone_-isaia- good , knows perfectly what_-isaia-_good for_man , and by virtue of his_very love proposes this good to man in the commandments . God s law does_not reduce , much less do away with human_freedom ; rather , it protects and promotes that freedom . In contrast , however , some present_day cultural tendencies have_given rise to several currents of thought in ethics which centre upon an alleged conflict between freedom and law . These doctrines would grant to individuals or social groups the right to determine what_-isaia-_good or evil . Human freedom would thus be able to '' create values '' and would enjoy a primacy over truth , to the point that_truth itself would be considered a creation of freedom . Freedom would thus lay claim to a moral autonomy which_would actually amount to an absolute sovereignty . The modern concern_for the claims of autonomy has not failed to exercise an influence also in the sphere of Catholic moral theology . While the latter has certainly never attempted to set human_freedom against the divine_law or to question the existence of an ultimate religious foundation for moral norms , it has , nonetheless , been led to undertake a profound rethinking about the role of reason and of faith in identifying moral norms with reference to specific '' innerworldly '' kinds of behaviour involving oneself , others and the material world . It must be acknowledged that underlying this_work of rethinking there_are certain positive concerns which to a great extent belong to the best tradition of Catholic thought . In response to the encouragement of the Second Vatican Council , there_has been a desire to foster dialogue_with modern culture , emphasizing the rational and thus universally understandable and communicable character of moral norms belonging to the sphere of the natural moral_law . There has_also been an attempt to reaffirm the interior character of the ethical requirements deriving from that law , requirements which create an obligation for the will only_because such an obligation was previously acknowledged by human_reason and , concretely , by personal conscience . Some people , however , disregarding the dependence of human_reason on Divine Wisdom and the need , given the present state of fallen nature , for Divine Revelation as an effective means_for knowing moral truths , even_those of the natural order , have actually posited a complete sovereignty of reason in the domain of moral norms regarding the right ordering of life in this_world . Such norms would constitute the boundaries for a merely '' human '' morality ; they_would be the expression of a law which_man in an autonomous manner lays down for_himself and which_has its source exclusively in human_reason . In no way could God be considered the Author of this_law , except in the sense_that human_reason exercises its autonomy in setting down laws by virtue of a primordial and total mandate given to man by God . These trends of thought have led to a denial , in opposition to Sacred Scripture cf . Mt : and the Church s constant teaching , of the fact_that the natural moral_law has God as its author , and that_man , by the use of reason , participates in the eternal law , which_it_-isaia- not_for him to establish . In their desire , however , to keep the moral_life in a Christian context , certain moral theologians have introduced a sharp distinction , contrary to Catholic doctrine , between an ethical order , which_would be human in origin and of value for this_world alone , and an order of salvation , for_which only certain intentions and interior attitudes regarding God and neighbour would be significant . This has then led to an actual denial that_there exists , in Divine Revelation , a specific and determined moral content , universally valid and permanent . The word of God would be limited to proposing an exhortation , a generic paraenesis , which_the autonomous reason alone would then have_the task of completing with normative directives which_are truly '' objective '' , that_-isaia- , adapted to the concrete historical situation . Naturally , an autonomy conceived in this_way also involves the denial of a specific doctrinal competence on the part of the Church and her Magisterium with_regard to particular moral norms which deal_with the so called '' human good '' . Such norms would_not be part of the proper content of Revelation , and would_not in themselves be relevant for salvation . No one_can fail to see that_such an interpretation of the autonomy of human_reason involves positions incompatible with Catholic teaching . In such a context it -isaia- absolutely necessary to clarify , in the light of the word of God and the living Tradition of the Church , the fundamental notions of human_freedom and of the moral_law , as well as their profound and intimate relationship . Only thus will it be possible to respond to the rightful claims of human_reason in a way which accepts the valid elements present in certain currents of contemporary moral theology without compromising the Church s heritage of moral teaching with ideas derived_from an erroneous concept of autonomy . '' God left man in the power of his_own counsel '' Sir : . Taking up the words of Sirach , the Second Vatican Council explains the meaning of that '' genuine freedom '' which_-isaia- '' an outstanding manifestation of the divine image '' in man : '' God willed to leave man in the power of his_own counsel , so that he would seek his Creator of his_own accord and would freely arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- full and blessed perfection by cleaving to God '' . These words indicate the wonderful depth of the sharing in God s dominion to which_man has been_called : they indicate that_man s dominion extends in a certain_sense over man_himself . This has_been a constantly recurring theme in theological reflection on human_freedom , which_-isaia- described as a form of kingship . For example , Saint Gregory of Nyssa writes : '' The soul shows its royal and exalted character . in that_it_-isaia- free and self governed , swayed autonomously by its_own will . Of whom else can this be said , save a king ? . Thus human_nature , created to rule other creatures , was by its likeness to the King of the universe made as it were a living image , partaking with the Archetype both in dignity and in name '' . The exercise of dominion over the world represents a great and responsible task for_man , one_which involves his freedom in obedience to the Creator s command : '' Fill the earth and subdue it '' Gen : . In view of this , a rightful autonomy -isaia- due to every man , as well as to the human community , a fact to which_the Council s Constitution Gaudium et spes calls special_attention . This -isaia- the autonomy of earthly realities , which means_that '' created things have_their own laws and values_which are to be gradually discovered , utilized and ordered by man '' . Not only the world , however , but_also man_himself has_been entrusted to his_own care and responsibility . God left man '' in the power of his_own counsel '' Sir : , that_he_might seek his Creator and freely attain perfection . Attaining such perfection means personally building up that perfection in himself . Indeed , just as man in exercising his dominion over the world shapes it in accordance_with his_own intelligence and will , so too in performing morally good acts , man strengthens , develops and consolidates within himself his likeness to God . Even so , the Council warns against a false concept of the autonomy of earthly realities , one which_would maintain that '' created things_are not dependent on God and that_man can use them without reference to their Creator '' . With regard to man_himself , such a concept of autonomy produces particularly baneful effects , and eventually leads to atheism : '' Without its Creator the creature simply disappears . If God -isaia- ignored the creature itself_-isaia- impoverished '' . The teaching of the Council emphasizes , on the one_hand , the role of human_reason in discovering and applying the moral_law : the moral_life calls for that creativity and originality typical of the person , the source and cause of his_own deliberate acts . On the other_hand , reason draws its_own truth and authority from the eternal law , which_-isaia- none other_than divine wisdom itself . At the heart of the moral_life we thus find the principle of a '' rightful autonomy '' of man , the personal subject of his actions . The moral_law has its origin in God and always finds_its source in him : -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , by virtue of natural reason , which derives from divine wisdom , it -isaia- a properly human law . Indeed , as we have_seen , the natural_law '' -isaia- nothing other_than the light of understanding infused in us by God , whereby we understand what must be done and what must be avoided . God gave this light and this_law to man -atti_degli_apostoli- creation '' . The rightful autonomy of the practical reason means_that man possesses in himself his_own law , received_from_the Creator . Nevertheless , the autonomy of reason cannot mean that_reason itself creates values and moral norms . Were this autonomy to imply a denial of the participation of the practical reason in the wisdom of the divine Creator and Lawgiver , or were it to suggest a freedom which creates moral norms , on the basis of historical contingencies or the diversity of societies and cultures , this_sort of alleged autonomy would contradict the Church s teaching on the truth_about man . It would be the death of true freedom : '' But of the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil you shall_not eat , for in the day that_you eat of it you shall die '' Gen : . Man s genuine moral autonomy in no way means the rejection but_rather the acceptance of the moral_law , of God s command : '' The Lord God gave this command to the man . Human freedom and God s law meet and are_called to intersect , in the sense of man s free obedience to God and of God s completely gratuitous benevolence towards man . Hence obedience to God -isaia- not , as some would believe , a heteronomy , as if the moral_life were subject to the will of something all powerful , absolute , ex traneous to man and intolerant of his freedom . If in fact a heteronomy of morality were to mean a denial of man s self determination or the imposition of norms unrelated to his good , this_would be in contradiction to the Revelation of the Covenant and of the redemptive Incarnation . Such a heteronomy would be nothing but a form of alienation , contrary to divine wisdom and to the dignity_of_the_human_person . Others speak , and rightly so , of theonomy , or participated theonomy , since man s free obedience to God s law effectively implies that human_reason and human will participate in God s wisdom and providence . By forbidding man to '' eat of the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil '' , God makes it clear_that man does_not originally possess such '' knowledge '' as something properly his_own , but_only participates in it by the light of natural reason and of Divine Revelation , which manifest to him the requirements and the promptings of eternal wisdom . Law must_therefore be considered an expression of divine wisdom : by submitting to the law , freedom submits to the truth of creation . Consequently one_must acknowledge in the freedom of the human_person the image and the nearness of God , who_-isaia- present in all cf . But one_must likewise acknowledge_the majesty of the God of the universe and revere the holiness of the law of God , who_-isaia- infinitely transcendent : Deus semper maior . Blessed -isaia- the man_who takes delight in the law of the Lord cf . Patterned on God s freedom , man s freedom_-isaia- not negated by his obedience to the divine_law ; indeed , only through_this obedience does it abide in the truth and conform to human_dignity . This -isaia- clearly stated by the Council : '' Human dignity requires man to act through conscious and free choice , as motivated and prompted personally from within , and not through blind internal impulse or merely external pressure . Man achieves such dignity when he frees himself from all subservience to his feelings , and in a free choice of the good , pursues his_own end by effectively and assiduously marshalling the appropriate means '' . In his journey towards God , the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' , man must freely do good and avoid evil . But in order to accomplish this he must be able to distinguish good from evil . And this takes_place above all thanks to the light of natural reason , the reflection in man of the splendour of God s countenance . Thus Saint Thomas , commenting on a verse of Psalm , writes : '' After saying : Offer right sacrifices Ps : , as if some had then asked him what right works were , the Psalmist adds : There are_many who say : Who will_make us see good ? And in reply to the question he says : The light of your face , Lord , -isaia- signed upon us , thereby implying that the light of natural reason whereby we discern good from evil , which_-isaia- the function of the natural_law , -isaia- nothing else but an imprint on us of the divine light '' . It also becomes clear why this law_-isaia- called the natural_law : it receives this name not because it refers to the nature of irrational beings but because the reason which promulgates it -isaia- proper to human_nature . The Second Vatican Council points_out that the '' supreme rule of life_-isaia- the divine_law itself , the eternal , objective and universal law by which God out of his wisdom and love arranges , directs and governs the whole_world and the paths of the human community . God has enabled man to share in this_divine law , and hence man_-isaia- able under the gentle guidance of God s providence increasingly to recognize_the unchanging truth '' . The Council refers back to the classic teaching on God s eternal law . Saint Augustine defines this as '' the reason or the will of God , who commands us to respect the natural order and forbids us to disturb it '' . Saint Thomas identifies it with '' the type of the divine wisdom as moving all things to their due end '' . And God s wisdom -isaia- providence , a love_which cares . God himself loves and cares , in the most literal and basic sense , for all creation cf . But God provides for_man differently from the way_in_which he provides for beings which_are not persons . He cares for_man not '' from without '' , through the laws of physical nature , but '' from within '' , through reason , which , by its natural knowledge of God s eternal law , -isaia- consequently able to show man the right direction to take in his free actions . In this_way God calls man to participate in his_own providence , since he desires to guide the world not_only the world of nature but_also the world of human persons through man_himself , through man s reasonable and responsible care . The natural_law enters here as the human expression of God s eternal law . Saint Thomas writes : '' Among all others , the rational creature -isaia- subject to divine_providence in the most excellent way , insofar as it partakes of a share of providence , being provident both_for itself and for others . Thus it has a share of the Eternal Reason , whereby it has a natural inclination to its_proper act and end . This participation of the eternal law in the rational creature -isaia- called natural_law '' . The Church has often made reference to the Thomistic doctrine of natural_law , including it in her_own teaching on morality . Thus my Venerable Predecessor Leo XIII emphasized the essential subordination of reason and human law to the Wisdom of God and to his law . After stating that '' the natural law_-isaia- written and engraved in the heart of each_and_every man , since_it_-isaia- none other_than human_reason itself which commands us to do good and counsels us not to sin '' , Leo XIII appealed to the '' higher reason '' of the divine Lawgiver : '' But this prescription of human_reason could_not have_the force of law unless it were_the voice and the interpreter of some higher reason to which_our spirit and our freedom must be subject '' . Indeed , the force of law consists in its authority to impose duties , to confer rights and to sanction certain behaviour : '' Now all of this , clearly , could_not exist in man if , as his_own supreme legislator , he gave himself_the rule of his_own actions '' . And he concluded : '' It follows_that the natural law_-isaia- itself the eternal law , implanted in beings endowed_with reason , and inclining them towards their right action and end ; it -isaia- none other_than the eternal reason of the Creator and Ruler of the universe '' . Man -isaia- able to recognize good_and_evil thanks to that discernment of good from evil which he himself carries out by his reason , in particular by his reason enlightened by Divine Revelation and by faith , through the law which God gave to the Chosen People , beginning with the commandments on Sinai . Israel was called to accept and to live out God s law as a particular gift and sign of its election and of the divine Covenant , and also as a pledge of God s blessing . Thus Moses could address the children of Israel and ask them : '' What great nation -isaia- that that_has a god so near to it as the Lord our God -isaia- to us , whenever we call_upon him ? And what great nation -isaia- there that_has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this_law which I set before you this_day ? '' Dt : . In the Psalms we encounter the sentiments of praise , gratitude and veneration which_the Chosen People -isaia- called to show towards God s law , together_with an exhortation to know it , ponder it and translate it into life . '' Blessed -isaia- the man_who walks not in the counsel of the wicked , nor stands in the way of sinners , nor sits in the seat of scoffers , but his delight -isaia- in the law of the Lord and on his law he meditates day and night '' Ps : . '' The law of the Lord -isaia- perfect , reviving the soul ; the testimony of the Lord -isaia- sure , making wise the simple ; the precepts of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart ; the commandment of the Lord -isaia- pure , enlightening the eyes '' Ps : . The Church gratefully accepts and lovingly preserves the entire deposit of Revelation , treating it with religious respect and fulfilling her_mission of authentically interpreting God s law in the light of the Gospel . In addition , the Church receives the gift of the New Law , which_-isaia- the '' fulfilment '' of God s law in Jesus Christ and in his Spirit . This -isaia- an '' interior '' law cf . Jer : , '' written not_with ink but_with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts '' Cor : ; a law of perfection and of freedom cf . Cor : ; '' the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus '' Rom : . Saint Thomas writes that_this law '' can be called law in two ways . First , the law of the spirit_-isaia- the Holy Spirit . who , dwelling in the soul , not_only teaches what it -isaia- necessary to do by enlightening the intellect on the things to be done , but_also inclines the affections to act with uprightness . Second , the law of the spirit can be called the proper effect of the Holy Spirit , and thus faith working through love cf . Gal : , which teaches inwardly about the things to be done . and inclines the affections to act '' . Even if moral theological reflection usually distinguishes between_the positive or revealed law of God and the natural_law , and , within_the economy of salvation , between_the '' old '' and the '' new '' law , it must_not be forgotten that_these and other useful distinctions always refer to that law whose author -isaia- the one_and_the_same God and which_-isaia- always meant for_man . The different_ways in which God , acting in history , cares for the world and for mankind are_not mutually exclusive ; on the contrary , they support each_other and intersect . They have_their origin and goal in the eternal , wise and loving counsel whereby God predestines men_and_women '' to be conformed to the image of his Son '' Rom : . God s plan poses no threat to man s genuine freedom ; on the contrary , the acceptance of God s plan -isaia-_the_only way to affirm that freedom . '' What the law requires -isaia- written on their_hearts '' Rom : . The alleged conflict between freedom and law_-isaia- forcefully brought up once_again today with_regard to the natural_law , and particularly with_regard to nature . Debates about nature and freedom have_always marked the history of moral reflection ; they grew especially heated -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Renaissance and the Reformation , as can be seen from the teaching of the Council of Trent . Our own age -isaia- marked , though in a different sense , by a similar tension . The penchant for empirical observation , the procedures of scientific objectification , technological progress and certain forms of liberalism have led to these_two terms being set in opposition , as if a dialectic , if not an absolute conflict , between freedom and nature were characteristic of the structure of human_history . At other periods , it seemed that '' nature '' subjected man totally to its_own dynamics and even its_own unbreakable laws . Today too , the situation of the world of the senses within space and time , physio chemical constants , bodily processes , psychological impulses and forms of social conditioning seem to many_people the only really decisive factors of human reality . In this_context even moral facts , despite their specificity , are frequently treated as if they_were statistically verifiable data , patterns of behaviour which_can be subject to observation or explained exclusively in categories of psychosocial processes . As a result , some ethicists , professionally engaged in the study of human realities and behaviour , can be tempted to take as the standard for their discipline and even_for its operative norms the results of a statistical study of concrete human behaviour patterns and the opinions about morality encountered in the majority of people . Other moralists , however , in their concern to stress the importance of values , remain sensitive to the dignity of freedom , but_they frequently conceive of freedom as somehow in opposition to or in conflict with material and biological nature , over which it must progressively assert itself . Here various approaches are_-atti_degli_apostoli- one in overlooking the created dimension of nature and in misunderstanding its integrity . For some , '' nature '' becomes reduced to raw material for_human activity and for its power : thus nature needs to be profoundly transformed , and indeed overcome by freedom , inasmuch as it represents a limitation and denial of freedom . For others , it -isaia- in the untrammelled advancement of man s power , or of his freedom , that economic , cultural , social and even moral values are established : nature would thus come to mean everything found in man and the world apart_from freedom . In such an understanding , nature would include in the first_place the human body , its make up and its processes : against this physical datum would be opposed whatever_-isaia- '' constructed '' , in other_words '' culture '' , seen as the product and result of freedom . Human nature , understood in this_way , could be reduced to and treated as a readily available biological or social material . This ultimately means making freedom selfdefining and a phenomenon creative of itself and its values . Indeed , when all -isaia- said and done man would_not even have a nature ; he would be his_own personal life project . Man would be nothing_more than his_own freedom ! . In this_context , objections of physicalism and naturalism have_been levelled against the traditional conception of the natural_law , which_-isaia- accused of presenting as moral laws what_are in themselves mere biological laws . Consequently , in too superficial a way , a permanent and unchanging character would be attributed to certain kinds of human behaviour , and , on the basis of this , an attempt would be made to formulate universally valid moral norms . According to certain theologians , this_kind of '' biologistic or naturalistic argumentation '' would even be present in certain documents of the Church s Magisterium , particularly those dealing_with the area of sexual and conjugal ethics . It was , they maintain , on the basis of a naturalistic understanding of the sexual act that contraception , direct sterilization , autoeroticism , pre marital sexual relations , homosexual relations and artificial insemination were condemned as morally unacceptable . In the opinion of these same theologians , a morally negative evaluation of such acts fails to take_into adequate consideration both man s character as a rational and free being and the cultural conditioning of all moral norms . In their view , man , as a rational being , not_only can but actually must freely determine the meaning of his behaviour . This process of '' determining the meaning '' would obviously have to take into_account_the many limitations of the human_being , as existing in a body and in history . Furthermore , it would_have to take_into consideration the behavioural models and the meanings which_the latter acquire in any given culture . Above all , it would_have to respect the fundamental commandment of love of God and neighbour . Still , they continue , God made man as a rationally free being ; he left him '' in the power of his_own counsel '' and he expects him to shape his_life in a personal and rational way . Love of neighbour would mean above all and even exclusively respect_for his freedom to make his_own decisions . The workings of typically human behaviour , as well as the so called '' natural inclinations '' , would establish -atti_degli_apostoli- the most so they_say a general orientation towards correct behaviour , but they_cannot determine the moral assessment of individual human acts , so complex from the viewpoint of situations . Faced with this theory , one_has to consider carefully the correct relationship existing between freedom and human_nature , and in particular the place of the human body in questions of natural_law . A freedom which claims to be absolute ends up treating the human body as a raw datum , devoid of any meaning and moral values until freedom has shaped it in accordance_with its design . Consequently , human_nature and the body appear as presuppositions or preambles , materially necessary_for freedom to make its choice , yet extrinsic to the person , the subject and the human act . Their functions would_not be able to constitute reference points for moral decisions , because the finalities of these inclinations would be merely '' physical '' goods , called by some '' pre moral '' . To refer to them , in order to find in them rational indications with_regard to the order of morality , would be to expose oneself to the accusation of physicalism or biologism . In this_way of thinking , the tension between freedom and a nature conceived of in a reductive way -isaia- resolved by a division within man_himself . This moral theory does_not correspond to the truth_about man and his freedom . It contradicts the Church s teachings on the unity of the human_person , whose rational soul -isaia- per se et essentialiter the form of his_body . The spiritual and immortal soul -isaia- the principle of unity of the human_being , whereby it exists as a whole corpore et anima unus as a person . These definitions not_only point_out that the body , which_has_been promised the resurrection , will_also share in glory . They also remind us that_reason and free will are linked_with all the bodily and sense faculties . The person , including the body , -isaia- completely entrusted to himself , and it -isaia- in the unity of body_and_soul that the person_-isaia- the subject of his_own moral acts . The person , by the light of reason and the support of virtue , discovers in the body the anticipatory signs , the expression and the promise of the gift_of_self , in conformity_with_the wise plan of the Creator . It -isaia- in the light of the dignity_of_the_human_person a dignity which_must be affirmed for its_own sake that_reason grasps the specific moral value of certain goods towards which_the person_-isaia- naturally inclined . And since_the human_person cannot be reduced to a freedom which_-isaia- self designing , but entails a particular spiritual and bodily structure , the primordial moral requirement of loving and respecting the person as an end and never as a mere means also implies , by its_very nature , respect_for certain fundamental goods , without_which one would fall_into relativism and arbitrariness . A doctrine which dissociates the moral act from the bodily dimensions of its exercise -isaia- contrary to the teaching of Scripture and Tradition . Such a doctrine revives , in new_forms , certain ancient errors which_have always_been opposed by the Church , inasmuch as they reduce the human_person to a '' spiritual '' and purely formal freedom . This reduction misunderstands the moral meaning of the body and of kinds of behaviour involving it cf . Saint Paul declares that '' the immoral , idolaters , adulterers , sexual perverts , thieves , the greedy , drunkards , revilers , robbers '' are excluded from the Kingdom of God cf . This condemnation repeated by the Council of Trent '' lists as '' mortal sins '' or '' immoral practices '' certain specific kinds of behaviour the wilful acceptance of which prevents believers from sharing in the inheritance promised to them . In fact , body_and_soul are inseparable : in the person , in the willing agent and in the deliberate act , they stand or fall together . At this_point the true meaning of the natural_law can be understood : it refers to man s proper and primordial nature , the '' nature of the human_person '' , which_-isaia- the person himself in the unity of soul and body , in the unity of his spiritual and biological inclinations and of all the other specific characteristics necessary_for the pursuit of his end . '' The natural moral_law expresses and lays down the purposes , rights_and_duties which_are based upon the bodily and spiritual nature of the human_person . Therefore this_law cannot be thought of as simply a set of norms on the biological level ; rather it must be defined as the rational order whereby man_-isaia- called by the Creator to direct and regulate his_life and actions and in particular to make_use of his_own body '' . To give an example , the origin and the foundation of the duty of absolute respect_for human_life are to be found in the dignity proper to the person and not_simply in the natural inclination to preserve one_s_own physical life . Human life , even_though it -isaia- a fundamental good of man , thus acquires a moral significance in reference to the good of the person , who must_always be affirmed for his_own sake . While it -isaia- always morally illicit to kill an innocent human_being , it can be licit , praiseworthy or even imperative to give up one_s_own life cf . Jn : out of love of neighbour or as a witness to the truth . Only in reference to the human_person in his '' unified totality '' , that_-isaia- , as '' a soul which expresses itself in a body and a body informed by an immortal spirit '' , can the specifically human meaning of the body be grasped . Indeed , natural inclinations take on moral relevance only insofar as they refer to the human_person and his authentic fulfilment , a fulfilment which for that matter can take_place always and only in human_nature . By rejecting all manipulations of corporeity which alter its human meaning , the Church serves man and shows him the path of true love , the only path on which he can_find the true God . The natural_law thus understood does not_allow for_any division between freedom and nature . Indeed , these_two realities are harmoniously bound together , and each -isaia- intimately linked to the other . '' From the beginning it was_not so '' Mt : . The alleged conflict between freedom and nature also_has repercussions on the interpretation of certain specific aspects of the natural_law , especially its universality and immutability . '' Where then are these rules written '' , Saint Augustine wondered , '' except in the book of that light which_-isaia- called truth ? From thence every just law_-isaia- transcribed and transferred to the heart of the man_who works justice , not by wandering but by being , as it were , impressed upon it , just as the image from the ring passes over to the wax , and yet does_not leave the ring '' . Precisely because of this '' truth '' the natural_law involves universality . Inasmuch as it -isaia- inscribed in the rational nature of the person , it makes itself felt to all beings endowed_with reason and living in history . In order to perfect himself in his specific order , the person must do good and avoid evil , be concerned for the transmission and preservation of life , refine and develop the riches of the material world , cultivate social_life , seek truth , practise good and contemplate beauty . The separation which some have posited between_the freedom of individuals and the nature which all have in common , as it emerges from certain philosophical theories which_are highly influential in present_day culture , obscures the perception of the universality of the moral_law on the part of reason . But inasmuch as the natural_law expresses the dignity_of_the_human_person and lays the foundation for his fundamental rights_and_duties , it -isaia- universal in its precepts and its authority extends to all mankind . This universality does_not ignore the individuality of human_beings , nor_-isaia- it opposed to the absolute uniqueness of each_person . On the contrary , it embraces -atti_degli_apostoli- its root each of the person s free acts , which_are meant to bear_witness to the universality of the true good . By submitting to the common law , our acts build up the true communion of persons and , by God s grace , practise charity , '' which binds everything together in perfect harmony '' Col : . When on the contrary they disregard the law , or even are merely ignorant of it , whether culpably or not , our acts damage the communion of persons , to the detriment of each . It -isaia- right and just , always and for everyone , to serve God , to render him the worship which_-isaia- his due and to honour one s parents as they deserve . Positive precepts such as these , which order us to perform certain actions and to cultivate certain dispositions , are universally binding ; they_are '' unchanging '' . They unite in the same common_good all people of every period of history , created for '' the same divine calling and destiny '' . These universal and permanent laws correspond to things known by the practical reason and are applied to particular acts through the judgment of conscience . The acting subject personally assimilates the truth contained in the law . He appropriates this_truth of his being and makes it his_own by his acts and the corresponding virtues . The negative precepts of the natural_law are universally valid . They oblige each and every_individual , always and in every circumstance . It -isaia-_a_matter of prohibitions which forbid a given action semper et pro semper , without exception , because the choice of this_kind of behaviour -isaia- in no case compatible with the goodness of the will of the acting person , with_his vocation to life with God and to communion with_his neighbour . It -isaia- prohibited to everyone and in every case to violate these precepts . They oblige everyone , regardless of the cost , never to offend in anyone , beginning with oneself , the personal_dignity common to all . On the other_hand , the fact_that only the negative commandments oblige always and under all circumstances does_not_mean that in the moral_life prohibitions are more_important than the obligation to do good indicated by the positive commandments . The reason -isaia- this : the commandment of love of God and neighbour does_not have in its dynamic any higher limit , but it does have a lower limit , beneath which_the commandment -isaia- broken . Furthermore , what must be done in any given situation depends on the circumstances , not all of which_can be foreseen ; on the other_hand there_are kinds of behaviour which can_never , in any situation , be a proper response a response which_-isaia- in conformity_with_the dignity of the person . Finally , it -isaia- always possible that_man , as the result of coercion or other circumstances , can be hindered from doing certain good actions ; but he can_never be hindered from not doing certain actions , especially if he -isaia- prepared to die rather_than to do evil . The Church has_always taught that_one may never choose kinds of behaviour prohibited by the moral commandments expressed in negative form in the Old and New Testaments . As we have_seen , Jesus himself reaffirms that_these prohibitions allow no exceptions : '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments . You shall_not murder , You shall_not commit adultery , You shall_not steal , You shall_not bear false witness '' Mt : . The great concern of our contemporaries for historicity and for culture has led some to call into question the immutability of the natural_law itself , and thus_the existence of '' objective norms of morality '' valid for all people of the present and the future , as for those of the past . Is it ever possible , they ask , to consider as universally valid and always binding certain rational determinations established in the past , when no one knew the progress humanity would make in the future ? It must certainly be admitted that_man always exists in a particular culture , but it must_also be admitted that man_-isaia- not exhaustively defined by that_same culture . Moreover , the very progress of cultures demonstrates that_there_-isaia- something in man which transcends those cultures . This '' something '' -isaia- precisely human_nature : this nature_-isaia- itself the measure of culture and the condition ensuring that_man does_not become the prisoner of any of his cultures , but asserts his personal_dignity by living in accordance_with_the profound truth of his being . To call into question the permanent structural elements of man which_are connected_with his_own bodily dimension would_not only conflict with common experience , but would render meaningless Jesus reference to the '' beginning '' , precisely where_the social_and_cultural context of the time had distorted the primordial meaning and the role of certain moral norms cf . This -isaia- the reason_why '' the Church affirms that underlying so many changes there_are_some things_which do not change and are ultimately founded upon Christ , who -isaia-_the_same yesterday and today and for ever '' . Christ -isaia- the '' Beginning '' who , having taken on human_nature , definitively illumines it in its constitutive elements and in its dynamism of charity towards God and neighbour . Certainly there_-isaia-_a_need to seek out and to discover the most adequate formulation for universal and permanent moral norms in the light of different cultural contexts , a formulation most capable of ceaselessly expressing their historical relevance , of making them understood and of authentically interpreting their truth . This truth of the moral_law like that of the '' deposit of faith '' unfolds down_the_centuries : the norms expressing that_truth remain valid in their substance , but must be specified and determined '' eodem sensu eademque sententia '' in the light of historical circumstances by the Church s Magisterium , whose decision -isaia- preceded and accompanied by the work of interpretation and formulation characteristic of the reason of individual believers and of theological reflection . Conscience and truth Man s sanctuary . The relationship_between man s freedom and God s law_-isaia- most deeply lived out in the '' heart '' of the person , in his moral conscience . As the Second Vatican Council observed : '' In the depths of his conscience man detects a law which he does_not impose on himself , but_which holds him to obedience . Always summoning him to love good and avoid evil , the voice of conscience can when necessary speak to his_heart more specifically : do this , shun that . For man_has in his_heart a law written by God . To obey it -isaia- the very dignity of man ; according to it he will be judged cf . The way_in_which one conceives the relationship_between freedom and law_-isaia- thus intimately bound up with one s understanding of the moral conscience . Here the cultural tendencies referred to above in which freedom and law are set in opposition to each_other and kept apart , and freedom_-isaia- exalted almost to the point of idolatry lead to a '' creative '' understanding of moral conscience , which diverges from the teaching of the Church s tradition and her Magisterium . According to the opinion of some theologians , the function of conscience had_been reduced , -atti_degli_apostoli- least -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain period in the past , to a simple application of general moral norms to individual cases in the life of the person . But those norms , they continue , cannot be expected to foresee and to respect all the individual concrete acts of the person in all their uniqueness and particularity . While such norms might somehow be useful for a correct assessment of the situation , they_cannot replace the individual personal decision on how to act in particular cases . The critique already mentioned of the traditional understanding of human_nature and of its importance for the moral_life has even led certain authors to state that_these norms are not_so_much a binding objective criterion for judgments of conscience , but a general perspective which helps man tentatively to put order into_his personal and social_life . These authors also stress the complexity typical of the phenomenon of conscience , a complexity profoundly related to the whole sphere of psychology and the emotions , and to the numerous influences exerted by the individual s social_and_cultural environment . On the other_hand , they give maximum attention to the value of conscience , which_the Council itself defined as '' the sanctuary of man , where he -isaia- alone with God whose voice echoes within him '' . This voice , it -isaia- said , leads man not_so_much to a meticulous observance of universal norms as to a creative and responsible acceptance of the personal tasks entrusted to him by God . In their desire to emphasize the '' creative '' character of conscience , certain authors no longer call its actions '' judgments '' but '' decisions '' : only by making these decisions '' autonomously '' would man be able to attain moral maturity . Some even hold that this_process of maturing -isaia- inhibited by the excessively categorical position adopted by the Church s Magisterium in many moral questions ; for them , the Church s interventions are the cause of unnecessary conflicts of conscience . In order to justify these positions , some authors have proposed a kind of double status of moral truth . Beyond the doctrinal and abstract level , one would_have to acknowledge_the priority of a certain more concrete existential consideration . The latter , by taking account of circumstances and the situation , could legitimately be the basis of certain exceptions to the general rule and thus permit one to do in practice and in good conscience what_-isaia- qualified as intrinsically evil by the moral_law . A separation , or even an opposition , -isaia- thus established in some cases between_the teaching of the precept , which_-isaia- valid in general , and the norm of the individual conscience , which_would in fact make_the final decision about what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . On this basis , an attempt -isaia- made to legitimize so called '' pastoral '' solutions contrary to the teaching of the Magisterium , and to justify a '' creative '' hermeneutic according to which_the moral conscience -isaia- in no way obliged , in every case , by a particular negative precept . No one_can fail to realize_that these approaches pose a challenge to the very identity of the moral conscience in relation to human_freedom and God s law . Only the clarification made earlier with_regard to the relationship , based on truth , between freedom and law makes possible a discernment concerning this '' creative '' understanding of conscience . The judgment of conscience . The text of the Letter to the Romans which_has helped us to grasp the essence of the natural_law also indicates the biblical understanding of conscience , especially in its specific connection_with the law : '' When Gentiles who have_not the law do by nature what_the law requires , they_are a law unto themselves , even_though they_do_not have_the law . They show that_what the law requires -isaia- written on their_hearts , while their conscience also bears_witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them '' Rom : . According to Saint Paul , conscience in a certain_sense confronts man with the law , and thus becomes a '' witness '' for_man : a witness of his_own faithfulness or unfaithfulness with_regard to the law , of his essential moral rectitude or iniquity . Conscience -isaia-_the_only witness , since what takes_place in the heart of the person_-isaia- hidden from the eyes of everyone outside . Conscience makes its witness known only to the person himself . And , in turn , only the person himself knows what his_own response -isaia- to the voice of conscience . The importance of this interior dialogue of man with himself can_never be adequately appreciated . But it -isaia-_also a dialogue of man with God , the author of the law , the primordial image and final end of man . Saint Bonaventure teaches_that '' conscience -isaia- like God s herald and messenger ; it does_not command things on its_own authority , but commands them as coming from God s authority , like a herald when he proclaims_the edict of the king . This -isaia- why conscience has binding force '' . Thus it can_be_said that conscience bears_witness to man s own rectitude or iniquity to man_himself but , together_with this and indeed even beforehand , conscience -isaia- the witness of God himself , whose voice and judgment penetrate the depths of man s soul , calling him fortiter et suaviter to obedience . '' Moral conscience does_not close man within an insurmountable and impenetrable solitude , but opens him to the call , to the voice of God . In this , and not in anything else , lies the entire mystery and the dignity of the moral conscience : in being the place , the sacred place_where God speaks to man '' . Saint Paul does_not merely acknowledge that conscience acts as a '' witness '' ; he also reveals the way_in_which conscience performs that function . He speaks of '' conflicting thoughts '' which accuse or excuse the Gentiles with_regard to their behaviour cf . The term '' conflicting thoughts '' clarifies the precise nature of conscience : it -isaia- a moral judgment about man and his actions , a judgment either of acquittal or of condemnation , according as human acts are in conformity or not_with the law of God written on the heart . In the same text the Apostle clearly speaks of the judgment of actions , the judgment of their author and the moment when that judgment will be definitively rendered : '' This will take_place on that day when , according to my Gospel , God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus '' Rom : . The judgment of conscience -isaia- a practical judgment , a judgment which_makes known what man must do or not do , or which assesses an act already performed by him . It -isaia- a judgment which applies to a concrete situation the rational conviction_that one_must love and do good and avoid evil . This first principle of practical reason -isaia-_part of the natural_law ; indeed it constitutes the very foundation of the natural_law , inasmuch as it expresses that primordial insight about good_and_evil , that reflection of God s creative wisdom which , like an imperishable spark scintilla animae , shines in the heart of every man . But whereas the natural_law discloses the objective and universal demands of the moral good , conscience -isaia- the application of the law to a particular case ; this application of the law thus becomes an inner dictate for the individual , a summons to do what_-isaia-_good in this particular situation . Conscience thus formulates moral obligation in the light of the natural_law : it -isaia- the obligation to do what_the individual , through the workings of his conscience , knows to be a good he -isaia- called to do here and now . The universality of the law and its obligation are acknowledged , not suppressed , once reason has established the law s application in concrete present circumstances . The judgment of conscience states '' in an ultimate way '' whether a certain particular kind of behaviour -isaia- in conformity_with_the law ; it formulates the proximate norm of the morality of a voluntary act , '' applying the objective law to a particular case '' . Like the natural_law itself and all practical knowledge , the judgment of conscience also_has an imperative character : man must act in accordance_with it . If man acts against this judgment or , in a case where he lacks certainty about the rightness and goodness of a determined act , still performs that act , he stands condemned by his_own conscience , the proximate norm of personal morality . The dignity of this rational forum and the authority of its voice and judgments derive from the truth_about moral good_and_evil , which_it_-isaia- called to listen to and to express . This truth_-isaia- indicated by the '' divine_law '' , the universal and objective norm of morality . The judgment of conscience does_not establish the law ; rather it bears_witness to the authority of the natural_law and of the practical reason with reference to the supreme good , whose attractiveness the human_person perceives and whose commandments he accepts . '' Conscience -isaia- not an independent and exclusive capacity to decide what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . Rather there_-isaia- profoundly imprinted upon it a principle of obedience vis \u00e0 vis the objective norm which establishes and conditions the correspondence of its decisions with the commands and prohibitions which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of human behaviour '' . The truth_about moral good , as that truth_-isaia- declared in the law of reason , -isaia- practically and concretely recognized by the judgment of conscience , which_leads one to take responsibility_for the good or the evil one_has done . If man does evil , the just judgment of his conscience remains within him as a witness to the universal truth of the good , as well as to the malice of his particular choice . But the verdict of conscience remains in him also as a pledge of hope and mercy : while bearing_witness to the evil he has done , it also reminds him of his need , with the help of God s grace , to ask forgiveness , to do good and to cultivate virtue constantly . Consequently in the practical judgment of conscience , which imposes on the person the obligation to perform a given act , the link between freedom and truth_-isaia- made manifest . Precisely for this_reason conscience expresses itself in acts of '' judgment '' which reflect the truth_about the good , and not in arbitrary '' decisions '' . The maturity and responsibility of these judgments and , when all -isaia- said and done , of the individual who_-isaia- their subject are_not measured by the liberation of the conscience from objective truth , in favour of an alleged autonomy in personal decisions , but , on the contrary , by an insistent search_for truth and by allowing oneself to be guided by that_truth in one s actions . Seeking what_-isaia- true and good . Conscience , as the judgment of an act , -isaia- not exempt from the possibility of error . As the Council puts it , '' not infrequently conscience can be mistaken as a result of invincible ignorance , although it does_not on that account forfeit its dignity ; but_this cannot be said when a man shows little concern_for seeking what_-isaia- true and good , and conscience gradually becomes almost blind from being accustomed to sin '' . In these brief words the Council sums up the doctrine which_the Church down_the_centuries has developed with_regard to the erroneous conscience . Certainly , in order to have a '' good conscience '' Tim : , man must seek the truth and must make judgments in accordance_with that_same truth . As the Apostle Paul says , the conscience must be '' confirmed by the Holy Spirit '' cf . Rom : ; it must be '' clear '' Tim : ; it must_not '' practise cunning and tamper with God s word '' , but '' openly state the truth '' cf . On the other_hand , the Apostle also warns Christians : '' Do not be conformed to this_world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that_you_may prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect '' Rom : . Paul s admonition urges us to be watchful , warning us that in the judgments of our conscience the possibility of error -isaia- always present . Conscience -isaia- not an infallible judge ; it can_make mistakes . However , error of conscience can be the result of an invincible ignorance , an ignorance of which_the subject -isaia- not aware and which he -isaia- unable to overcome by himself . The Council reminds us that in cases where such invincible ignorance -isaia- not culpable , conscience does_not lose its dignity , because even_when it directs us to act in a way not in conformity_with_the objective moral_order , it continues to speak in the name of that truth_about the good which_the subject -isaia- called to seek sincerely . In any event , it -isaia- always from the truth_that the dignity of conscience derives . In the case of the correct conscience , it -isaia-_a_question of the objective truth received by man ; in the case of the erroneous conscience , it -isaia-_a_question of what man , mistakenly , subjectively considers to be true . It -isaia- never acceptable to confuse a '' subjective '' error about moral good with the '' objective '' truth rationally proposed to man in virtue of his end , or to make_the moral value of an act performed with a true and correct conscience equivalent to the moral value of an act performed by following the judgment of an erroneous conscience . It -isaia- possible that the evil done as the result of invincible ignorance or a non culpable error of judgment may_not be imputable to the agent ; but_even in this case it does not_cease to be an evil , a disorder in relation to the truth_about the good . Furthermore , a good act which_-isaia-_not recognized as such does_not contribute to the moral growth of the person_who performs it ; it does_not perfect him and it does_not help to dispose him for the supreme good . Thus , before feeling easily justified in the name of our conscience , we should reflect on the words of the Psalm : '' Who can discern his errors ? Clear me from hidden faults '' Ps : . There are faults which we fail to see but_which nevertheless remain faults , because we have refused to walk towards_the light cf . Conscience , as the ultimate concrete judgment , compromises its dignity when_it_-isaia- culpably erroneous , that_-isaia- to say , '' when man shows little concern_for seeking what_-isaia- true and good , and conscience gradually becomes almost blind from being accustomed to sin '' . Jesus alludes to the danger of the conscience being deformed when he warns : '' The eye -isaia- the lamp of the body . So if your eye -isaia- sound , your whole_body will be full of light ; but if your eye -isaia- not sound , your whole_body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you -isaia- darkness , how_great -isaia- the darkness ! '' Mt : . The words of Jesus just quoted also represent a call to form our conscience , to make it the object of a continuous conversion to what_-isaia- true and to what_-isaia-_good . In the same vein , Saint Paul exhorts us not to be conformed to the mentality of this_world , but to be transformed by the renewal of our_mind cf . It -isaia- the '' heart '' converted to the Lord and to the love of what_-isaia-_good which_-isaia- really the source of true judgments of conscience . Indeed , in order to '' prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect '' Rom : , knowledge of God s law in general -isaia- certainly necessary , but_it_-isaia- not sufficient : what_-isaia- essential -isaia- a sort of '' connaturality '' between man and the true good . Such a connaturality -isaia- rooted in and develops through the virtuous attitudes of the individual himself : prudence and the other cardinal virtues , and even before these the theological virtues of faith , hope and charity . This -isaia- the meaning of Jesus saying : '' He who_does what_-isaia- true comes to the light '' Jn : . Christians have a great help for the formation of conscience in the Church and her Magisterium . As the Council affirms : '' In forming their consciences the Christian faithful must give careful attention to the sacred and certain teaching of the Church . For the Catholic Church -isaia- by the will of Christ the teacher of truth . Her charge -isaia- to announce and teach authentically that_truth which_-isaia- Christ , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with_her authority to declare and confirm the principles of the moral_order which derive from human_nature itself '' . It follows_that the authority of the Church , when_she pronounces on moral questions , in no way undermines the freedom of conscience of Christians . This -isaia- so not only_because freedom of conscience -isaia- never freedom '' from '' the truth but always and only freedom '' in '' the truth , but also_because the Magisterium does_not bring to the Christian conscience truths_which are extraneous to it ; rather it brings to light the truths_which it ought already to possess , developing them_from the starting point of the primordial act of faith . The Church puts herself always and only -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of conscience , helping it to avoid being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine proposed by human deceit cf . Eph : , and helping it not to swerve from the truth_about the good of man , but_rather , especially in more difficult questions , to attain the truth with certainty and to abide in it . Fundamental choice and specific kinds of behaviour '' Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity_for the flesh '' Gal : . The heightened concern_for freedom in our_own day has led many students of the behavioural and the theological sciences to develop a more penetrating analysis of its_nature and of its dynamics . It has_been rightly pointed_out that freedom -isaia-_not_only the choice for one or another particular action ; it -isaia-_also , within that choice , a decision about oneself and a setting of one_s_own life_for or against the Good , for or against the Truth , and ultimately for or against God . Emphasis has rightly been placed on the importance of certain choices which '' shape '' a person s entire moral_life , and which serve as bounds within which other particular everyday choices can be situated and allowed to develop . Some authors , however , have proposed an even_more radical revision of the relationship_between person and acts . They speak of a '' fundamental freedom '' , deeper than and different from freedom of choice , which needs to be considered if human actions are to be correctly understood and evaluated . According to these authors , the key role in the moral life_-isaia- to be attributed to a '' fundamental option '' , brought_about by that fundamental freedom whereby_the person makes an overall self determination , not through a specific and conscious decision on the level of reflection , but in a '' transcendental '' and '' athematic '' way . Particular acts which flow from this option would constitute only partial and never definitive attempts to give it expression ; they_would only be its '' signs '' or symptoms . The immediate object of such acts would_not be absolute Good before which_the freedom of the person would be expressed on a transcendental level , but particular also termed '' categorical '' goods . In the opinion of some theologians , none of these goods , which by their nature are partial , could determine the freedom of man as a person in his totality , even_though it -isaia- only by bringing them about or refusing to do so that man_-isaia- able to express his_own fundamental option . A distinction thus comes to be introduced between_the fundamental option and deliberate choices of a concrete kind of behaviour . In some authors this division tends to become a separation , when_they expressly limit moral '' good '' and '' evil '' to the transcendental dimension proper to the fundamental option , and describe as '' right '' or '' wrong '' the choices of particular '' innerworldly '' kinds of behaviour : those , in other_words , concerning man s relationship_with himself , with_others and with the material world . There thus appears to be established within human acting a clear disjunction between two levels of morality : on the one_hand the order of good_and_evil , which_-isaia- dependent on the will , and on the other_hand specific kinds of behaviour , which_are judged to be morally right or wrong only on the basis of a technical calculation of the proportion between_the '' premoral '' or '' physical '' goods and evils which actually result from the action . This -isaia- pushed to the point where a concrete kind of behaviour , even one freely chosen , comes to be considered as a merely physical process , and not according to the criteria proper to a human act . The conclusion to which_this eventually leads -isaia- that the properly moral assessment of the person_-isaia- reserved to his fundamental option , prescinding in whole or in part from his choice of particular actions , of concrete kinds of behaviour . There -isaia- no doubt_that Christian moral teaching , even in its Biblical roots , acknowledges the specific importance of a fundamental choice which qualifies the moral_life and engages freedom on a radical level before God . It -isaia-_a_question of the decision of faith , of the obedience of faith cf . Rom : '' by which_man makes a total and free self commitment to God , offering the full submission of intellect and will to God as he reveals '' . This faith_,_which works through love cf . Gal : , comes_from_the core of man , from his '' heart '' cf . Rom : , whence it -isaia- called to bear_fruit in works cf . In the Decalogue one finds , as an introduction to the various commandments , the basic clause : '' I -amos- the Lord your God . '' Ex : , which , by impressing upon the numerous and varied particular prescriptions their primordial meaning , gives the morality of the Covenant its aspect of completeness , unity and profundity . Israel s fundamental decision , then , -isaia- about the fundamental commandment cf . The morality of the New Covenant -isaia- similarly dominated by the fundamental call of Jesus to follow_him thus he also says to the young_man : '' If you wish to be perfect . then come , follow me '' Mt : ; to this call the disciple must respond with a radical decision and choice . The Gospel parables of the treasure and the pearl of great price , for_which one sells all one s possessions , are eloquent and effective images of the radical and unconditional nature of the decision demanded by the Kingdom of God . The radical nature of the decision to follow Jesus -isaia- admirably expressed in his_own words : '' Whoever would save his_life will lose it ; and whoever loses his_life for my sake and the Gospel s will save it '' Mk : . Jesus call to '' come , follow me '' marks the greatest possible exaltation of human_freedom , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it witnesses to the truth and to the obligation of acts of faith and of decisions which_can be described as involving a fundamental option . We find a similar exaltation of human_freedom in the words of Saint Paul : '' You were called to freedom , brethren '' Gal : . But the Apostle immediately adds a grave warning : '' Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity_for the flesh '' . This warning echoes his earlier words : '' For freedom Christ has set us free ; stand fast therefore , and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery '' Gal : . Paul encourages us to be watchful , because freedom_-isaia- always threatened by slavery . And this_-isaia- precisely_the case when an act of faith in the sense of a fundamental option becomes separated_from the choice of particular acts , as in the tendencies mentioned above . These tendencies are therefore contrary to the teaching of Scripture itself , which sees the fundamental option as a genuine choice of freedom and links that choice profoundly to particular acts . By his fundamental choice , man_-isaia- capable of giving his_life direction and of progressing , with the help of grace , towards his end , following God s call . But this capacity -isaia- actually exercised in the particular choices of specific actions , through_which man deliberately conforms himself to God s will , wisdom and law . It thus needs to be stated_that the so called fundamental option , to the extent that_it_-isaia- distinct from a generic intention and hence one not_yet determined in such_a_way_that freedom_-isaia- obligated , -isaia- always brought into play through conscious and free decisions . Precisely for this_reason , it -isaia- revoked when man engages his freedom in conscious decisions to the contrary , with_regard to morally grave matter . To separate the fundamental option from concrete kinds of behaviour means to contradict the substantial integrity or personal unity of the moral agent in his_body and in his_soul . A fundamental option understood without explicit consideration of the potentialities which it puts into_effect and the determinations which express it does_not do justice to the rational finality immanent in man s acting and in each of his deliberate decisions . In point of fact , the morality of human acts -isaia- not deduced only from one s intention , orientation or fundamental option , understood as an intention devoid of a clearly determined binding content or as an intention with no corresponding positive effort to fulfil the different obligations of the moral_life . Judgments about morality cannot be made without taking_into consideration whether or not the deliberate choice of a specific kind of behaviour -isaia- in conformity_with_the dignity and integral vocation of the human_person . Every choice always implies a reference by the deliberate will to the goods and evils indicated by the natural_law as goods to be pursued and evils to be avoided . In the case of the positive moral precepts , prudence always has the task of verifying that_they apply in a specific situation , for example , in view of other duties which_may be more_important or urgent . But the negative moral precepts , those prohibiting certain concrete actions or kinds of behaviour as intrinsically evil , do not_allow for_any legitimate exception . They do not leave room , in any morally acceptable way , for the '' creativity '' of any contrary determination whatsoever . Once the moral species of an action prohibited by a universal rule -isaia- concretely recognized , the only morally good act -isaia- that of obeying the moral_law and of refraining from the action which it forbids . Here an important pastoral consideration must be added . According to the logic of the positions mentioned above , an individual could , by virtue of a fundamental option , remain faithful to God independently of whether or not certain of his choices and his acts are in conformity_with specific moral norms or rules . By virtue of a primordial option for charity , that individual could continue to be morally good , persevere in God s grace and attain salvation , even if certain of his specific kinds of behaviour were deliberately and gravely contrary to God s commandments as set_forth by the Church . In point of fact , man does_not suffer perdition only by being unfaithful to that fundamental option whereby he has made '' a free self commitment to God '' . With every freely committed mortal sin , he offends God as the giver of the law and as a result becomes guilty with_regard to the entire law cf . Jas : ; even if he perseveres in faith , he loses '' sanctifying grace '' , '' charity '' and '' eternal happiness '' . As the Council of Trent teaches , '' the grace of justification once received -isaia- lost not_only by apostasy , by which faith itself_-isaia- lost , but_also by any_other mortal sin '' . Mortal and venial sin . As we have just seen , reflection on the fundamental option has_also led some theologians to undertake a basic revision of the traditional distinction between mortal sins and venial sins . They insist that the opposition to God s law which causes the loss of sanctifying grace and eternal damnation , when one dies in such a state of sin could only be the result of an act which engages the person in his totality : in other_words , an act of fundamental option . According to these theologians , mortal sin , which separates man from God , only exists in the rejection of God , carried_out -atti_degli_apostoli- a level of freedom which_-isaia- neither to be identified with an act of choice nor capable of becoming the object of conscious awareness . Consequently , they go on to say , it -isaia- difficult , -atti_degli_apostoli- least psychologically , to accept the fact_that a Christian , who wishes to remain united to Jesus Christ and to his Church , could so easily and repeatedly commit mortal sins , as the '' matter '' itself of his actions would sometimes indicate . Likewise , it would be hard to accept that man_-isaia- able , in a brief lapse of time , to sever radically the bond of communion with God and afterwards be converted to him by sincere repentance . The gravity of sin , they maintain , ought to be measured by the degree of engagement of the freedom of the person performing an act , rather_than by the matter of that act . The Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia reaffirmed the importance and permanent validity of the distinction between mortal and venial sins , in accordance_with_the Church s tradition . And the Synod of Bishops , from which that Exhortation emerged , '' not_only reaffirmed the teaching of the Council of Trent concerning the existence and nature of mortal and venial sins , but it also recalled that mortal sin_-isaia- sin whose object -isaia- grave matter and which_-isaia- also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent '' . The statement of the Council of Trent does_not only consider_the '' grave matter '' of mortal sin ; it also recalls that_its necessary condition -isaia- '' full awareness and deliberate consent '' . In any event , both in moral theology and in pastoral practice one_-isaia- familiar with cases in which an act which_-isaia- grave by reason of its matter does_not constitute a mortal sin because of a lack of full awareness or deliberate consent on the part of the person performing it . Even so , '' care will_have to be taken not to reduce mortal sin to an act of fundamental option as -isaia- commonly said today against God '' , seen either as an explicit and formal rejection of God and neighbour or as an implicit and unconscious rejection of love . '' For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly , for whatever reason , chooses something gravely disordered . In fact , such a choice already includes contempt for the divine_law , a rejection of God s love for_humanity and the whole of creation : the person turns away from God and loses charity . Consequently , the fundamental orientation can be radically changed by particular acts . Clearly , situations can occur which_are very complex and obscure from a psychological viewpoint , and which influence the sinner s subjective imputability . But from a consideration of the psychological sphere one_cannot proceed to create a theological category , which_-isaia- precisely what_the fundamental option -isaia- , understanding it in such_a_way_that it objectively changes or casts doubt upon the traditional concept of mortal sin '' . The separation of fundamental option from deliberate choices of particular kinds of behaviour , disordered in themselves or in their circumstances , which_would not engage that option , thus involves a denial of Catholic doctrine on mortal sin : '' With the whole tradition of the Church , we call mortal sin the act by which_man freely and consciously rejects God , his law , the covenant of love_that God offers , preferring to turn in on himself or to some created and finite reality , something contrary to the divine will conversio ad creaturam . This can occur in a direct and formal way , in the sins of idolatry , apostasy and atheism ; or in an equivalent way , as in every act of disobedience to God s commandments in a grave matter '' . The moral act Teleology and teleologism . The relationship_between man s freedom and God s law , which_has its intimate and living centre in the moral conscience , -isaia- manifested and realized in human acts . It -isaia- precisely through_his acts that_man attains perfection as man , as one_who_-isaia- called to seek his Creator of his_own accord and freely to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him . Human acts are moral acts because_they express and determine the goodness or evil of the individual who performs them . They do not produce a change merely in the state of affairs outside of man but , to the extent that_they_are deliberate choices , they give moral definition to the very person_who performs them , determining his profound spiritual traits . This was perceptively noted by Saint Gregory of Nyssa : '' All things subject to change and to becoming never remain constant , but continually pass from one state to another , for better or worse . Now , human life_-isaia- always subject to change ; it needs to be born ever anew . But here birth does_not come about by a foreign intervention , as -isaia- the case with bodily beings . ; it -isaia- the result of a free choice . Thus we are in a certain way our_own parents , creating ourselves as we will , by our decisions '' . The morality of acts -isaia- defined by the relationship of man s freedom with the authentic good . This good -isaia- established , as the eternal law , by Divine Wisdom which orders every being towards its end : this eternal law_-isaia- known both by man s natural reason hence_it_-isaia- '' natural_law '' , and in an integral and perfect way by God s supernatural Revelation hence_it_-isaia- called '' divine_law '' . Acting -isaia- morally good when_the choices of freedom are in conformity_with man s true good and thus express the voluntary ordering of the person towards his ultimate end : God himself , the supreme good in whom man finds his full and perfect happiness . The first question in the young_man s conversation with Jesus : '' What good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' Mt : immediately brings out the essential connection_between the moral value of an act and man s final end . Jesus , in his reply , confirms the young_man s conviction : the performance of good acts , commanded by the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' , constitutes the indispensable condition of and path to eternal blessedness : '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . Jesus answer and his reference to the commandments also make it clear_that the path to that end -isaia- marked by respect_for the divine laws which safeguard human good . Only the act in conformity_with_the good can be a path that leads to life . The rational ordering of the human act to the good in its truth and the voluntary pursuit of that good , known by reason , constitute morality . Hence human activity cannot be judged as morally good merely because_it_-isaia- a means_for attaining one or another of its goals , or simply because the subject s intention -isaia- good . Activity -isaia- morally good when it attests to and expresses the voluntary ordering of the person to his ultimate end and the conformity of a concrete action with the human good as it -isaia- acknowledged in its truth by reason . If the object of the concrete action -isaia- not in harmony_with_the true good of the person , the choice of that action makes our will and ourselves morally evil , thus putting us in conflict with_our ultimate end , the supreme good , God himself . The Christian , thanks to God s Revelation and to faith , -isaia- aware of the '' newness '' which characterizes the morality of his actions : these actions are_called to show either consistency or inconsistency with_that dignity and vocation which_have_been bestowed on him by grace . In Jesus Christ and in his Spirit , the Christian -isaia- a '' new creation '' , a child of God ; by his actions he shows his likeness or unlikeness to the image of the Son who -isaia-_the_first born among many brethren cf . Rom : , he lives out his fidelity or infidelity to the gift of the Spirit , and he opens or closes himself to eternal_life , to the communion of vision , love and happiness with God the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . As Saint Cyril of Alexandria writes , Christ '' forms us according_to_his image , in such_a_way_that the traits of his_divine nature shine_forth in us through sanctification and justice and the life which_-isaia- good and in conformity_with virtue . The beauty of this image shines_forth in us who_are in Christ , when we show ourselves to be good in our works '' . Consequently the moral_life has an essential '' teleological '' character , since it consists in the deliberate ordering of human acts to God , the supreme good and ultimate end telos of man . This -isaia- attested to once_more by the question posed by the young_man to Jesus : '' What good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' . But this ordering to one s ultimate end -isaia- not something subjective , dependent solely upon one s intention . It presupposes that_such acts are in themselves capable of being ordered to this_end , insofar as they_are in conformity_with_the authentic moral good of man , safeguarded by the commandments . This -isaia- what Jesus himself points_out in his reply to the young_man : '' If you wish to enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . Clearly such an ordering must be rational and free , conscious and deliberate , by virtue of which man_-isaia- '' responsible '' for his actions and subject to the judgment of God , the just and good judge who , as the Apostle Paul reminds us , rewards good and punishes evil : '' We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that_each one may receive good or evil , according to what he has done in the body '' Cor : . But on what does the moral assessment of man s free acts depend ? What -isaia- it that ensures this ordering of human acts to God ? Is it the intention of the acting subject , the circumstances and in particular the consequences of his action , or the object itself of his act ? This -isaia- what_-isaia- traditionally called the problem of the '' sources of morality '' . Precisely with_regard to this problem there have emerged in the last few decades new or newly revived theological and cultural trends which call_for careful discernment on the part of the Church s Magisterium . Certain ethical theories , called '' teleological '' , claim to be concerned for the conformity of human acts with the ends pursued by the agent and with the values intended by him . The criteria for evaluating the moral rightness of an action are drawn_from the weighing of the non moral or pre moral goods to be gained and the corresponding non moral or pre moral values to be respected . For some , concrete behaviour would be right or wrong according as whether or not it -isaia- capable of producing a better state of affairs for all concerned . Right conduct would be the one capable of '' maximizing '' goods and '' minimizing '' evils . Many of the Catholic moralists who follow in this direction seek to distance themselves from utilitarianism and pragmatism , where_the morality of human acts would be judged without_any reference to the man s true ultimate end . They rightly recognize_the need to find ever_more consistent rational arguments in order to justify the requirements and to provide a foundation for the norms of the moral_life . This kind of investigation -isaia- legitimate and necessary , since_the moral_order , as established by the natural_law , -isaia- in principle accessible to human_reason . Furthermore , such investigation -isaia- well suited to meeting the demands of dialogue and cooperation_with non Catholics and non believers , especially in pluralistic societies . But as part of the effort to work out such a rational morality for this_reason it -isaia- sometimes called an '' autonomous morality '' there exist false solutions , linked in particular to an inadequate understanding of the object of moral action . Some authors do not take_into sufficient consideration the fact_that the will -isaia- involved in the concrete choices which it makes : these choices are a condition of its moral goodness and its being ordered to the ultimate end of the person . Others are inspired by a notion of freedom which prescinds from the actual conditions of its exercise , from its objective reference to the truth_about the good , and from its determination through choices of concrete kinds of behaviour . According to these theories , free will would neither be morally subjected to specific obligations nor shaped by its choices , while nonetheless still remaining responsible_for its_own acts and for their consequences . This '' teleologism '' , as a method for discovering the moral norm , can thus be called according to terminology and approaches imported from different currents of thought '' consequentialism '' or '' proportionalism '' . The former claims to draw the criteria of the rightness of a given way of acting solely from a calculation of foreseeable consequences deriving from a given choice . The latter , by weighing the various values and goods being sought , focuses rather on the proportion acknowledged between_the good and bad effects of that choice , with_a_view to the '' greater good '' or '' lesser evil '' actually possible in a particular situation . The teleological ethical theories proportionalism , consequentialism , while acknowledging that moral values are indicated by reason and by Revelation , maintain that_it_-isaia- never possible to formulate an absolute prohibition of particular kinds of behaviour which_would be in conflict , in every circumstance and in every culture , with_those values . The acting subject would indeed be responsible_for attaining the values pursued , but in two ways : the values or goods involved in a human act would be , from one viewpoint , of the moral_order in relation to properly moral values , such as love of God and neighbour , justice , etc . and , from another viewpoint , of the pre moral_order , which some term non moral , physical or ontic in relation to the advantages and disadvantages accruing both to the agent and to all other persons possibly involved , such as , for example , health or its endangerment , physical integrity , life , death , loss of material goods , etc . In a world where goodness -isaia- always mixed with evil , and every good effect linked to other evil effects , the morality of an act would be judged in two different_ways : its moral '' goodness '' would be judged on the basis of the subject s intention in reference to moral goods , and its '' rightness '' on the basis of a consideration of its foreseeable effects or consequences and of their proportion . Consequently , concrete kinds of behaviour could be described as '' right '' or '' wrong '' , without it being thereby possible to judge as morally '' good '' or '' bad '' the will of the person choosing them . In this_way , an act which , by contradicting a universal negative norm , directly violates goods considered as '' pre moral '' could be qualified as morally acceptable if the intention of the subject -isaia- focused , in accordance_with a '' responsible '' assessment of the goods involved in the concrete action , on the moral value judged to be decisive in the situation . The evaluation of the consequences of the action , based on the proportion between_the act and its effects and between_the effects themselves , would regard only the pre moral_order . The moral specificity of acts , that_-isaia- their goodness or evil , would be determined exclusively by the faithfulness of the person to the highest values of charity and prudence , without this faithfulness necessarily being incompatible with choices contrary to certain particular moral precepts . Even when grave matter -isaia- concerned , these precepts should be considered as operative norms which_are always relative and open to exceptions . In this view , deliberate consent to certain kinds of behaviour declared illicit by traditional moral theology would_not imply an objective moral evil . The object of the deliberate act . These theories can gain a certain persuasive force from their affinity to the scientific mentality , which_-isaia- rightly concerned_with ordering technical and economic activities on the basis of a calculation of resources and profits , procedures and their effects . They seek to provide liberation from the constraints of a voluntaristic and arbitrary morality of obligation which_would ultimately be dehumanizing . Such theories however are_not faithful to the Church s teaching , when_they believe they_can justify , as morally good , deliberate choices of kinds of behaviour contrary to the commandments of the divine and natural_law . These theories cannot claim to be grounded in the Catholic moral tradition . Although the latter did witness the development of a casuistry which tried to assess the best ways to achieve the good in certain concrete situations , it -isaia- nonetheless true that_this casuistry concerned only cases in which_the law was uncertain , and thus_the absolute validity of negative moral precepts , which oblige without exception , was_not called into question . The faithful_are obliged to acknowledge and respect the specific moral precepts declared and taught by the Church in the name of God , the Creator and Lord . When the Apostle Paul sums up the fulfilment of the law in the precept of love of neighbour as oneself cf . Rom : , he -isaia- not weakening the commandments but reinforcing them , since he -isaia- revealing their requirements and their gravity . Love of God and of one s neighbour cannot be separated_from the observance of the commandments of the Covenant renewed in the blood of Jesus Christ and in the gift of the Spirit . It -isaia- an honour characteristic of Christians to obey God rather_than men cf . Acts : ; : and accept even martyrdom as a consequence , like the holy men_and_women of the Old and New Testaments , who_are considered such because_they gave their_lives rather_than perform this or that particular act contrary to faith or virtue . In order to offer rational criteria for a right moral decision , the theories mentioned above take account of the intention and consequences of human action . Certainly there_-isaia- need to take into_account both the intention as Jesus forcefully insisted in clear disagreement with the scribes and Pharisees , who prescribed in great detail certain outward practices without paying attention to the heart cf . Mk : ; Mt : and the goods obtained and the evils avoided as a result of a particular act . Responsibility demands as much . But the consideration of these consequences , and also of intentions , -isaia- not sufficient for judging the moral quality of a concrete choice . The weighing of the goods and evils foreseeable as the consequence of an action -isaia- not an adequate method for determining whether the choice of that concrete kind of behaviour -isaia- '' according to its species '' , or '' in itself '' , morally good or bad , licit or illicit . The foreseeable consequences are part of those circumstances of the act , which , while capable of lessening the gravity of an evil act , nonetheless cannot alter its moral species . Moreover , everyone recognizes the difficulty , or rather the impossibility , of evaluating all the good_and_evil consequences and effects defined as pre moral of one_s_own acts : an exhaustive rational calculation -isaia- not_possible . How then can one go about establishing proportions which depend on a measuring , the criteria of which remain obscure ? How could an absolute obligation be justified on the basis of such debatable calculations ? . The morality of the human act depends primarily and fundamentally on the '' object '' rationally chosen by the deliberate will , as -isaia- borne out by the insightful analysis , still valid today , made by Saint Thomas . In order to be able to grasp the object of an act which specifies that act morally , it -isaia- therefore necessary to place oneself in the perspective of the acting person . The object of the act of willing -isaia-_in_fact a freely chosen kind of behaviour . To the extent that_it_-isaia- in conformity_with_the order of reason , it -isaia- the cause of the goodness of the will ; it perfects us morally , and disposes us to recognize our ultimate end in the perfect good , primordial love . By the object of a given moral act , then , one_cannot mean a process or an event of the merely physical order , to be assessed on the basis of its ability to bring_about a given state of affairs in the outside world . Rather , that object -isaia- the proximate end of a deliberate decision which determines the act of willing on the part of the acting person . Consequently , as the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches , '' there_are certain specific kinds of behaviour that_are always wrong to choose , because choosing them involves a disorder of the will , that_-isaia- , a moral evil '' . And Saint Thomas observes that '' it often happens_that man acts with a good intention , but without spiritual gain , because he lacks a good_will . Let us say that someone robs in order to feed the poor : in this case , even_though the intention -isaia- good , the uprightness of the will -isaia- lacking . Consequently , no evil done with a good intention can be excused . There are_those_who say : And why not do evil that good may come ? Their condemnation -isaia- just Rom : '' . The reason_why a good intention -isaia- not itself sufficient , but a correct choice of actions -isaia-_also needed , -isaia- that the human act depends on its object , whether that object -isaia- capable or not of being ordered to God , to the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' , and thus brings about the perfection of the person . An act -isaia- therefore good if its object -isaia- in conformity_with_the good of the person with_respect for the goods morally relevant for him . Christian ethics , which pays particular attention to the moral object , does_not refuse to consider_the inner '' teleology '' of acting , inasmuch as it -isaia-_directed to promoting the true good of the person ; but it recognizes that_it_-isaia- really pursued only_when the essential elements of human_nature are respected . The human act , good according to its object , -isaia-_also capable of being ordered to its ultimate end . That same act then attains its ultimate and decisive perfection when_the will actually does order it to God through charity . As the Patron of moral theologians and confessors teaches : '' It -isaia-_not_enough to do good_works ; they_need to be done well . For our works to be good and perfect , they_must be done for the sole purpose of pleasing God '' . '' Intrinsic evil '' : it -isaia- not licit to do evil that good may come of it cf . One must_therefore reject the thesis , characteristic of teleological and proportionalist theories , which holds that_it_-isaia- impossible to qualify as morally evil according to its species its '' object '' the deliberate choice of certain kinds of behaviour or specific acts , apart_from a consideration of the intention for_which the choice -isaia- made or the totality of the foreseeable consequences of that act for all persons concerned . The primary and decisive element for moral judgment -isaia- the object of the human act , which establishes whether it -isaia- capable of being ordered to the good and to the ultimate end , which_-isaia- God . This capability -isaia- grasped by reason in the very being of man , considered in his integral truth , and therefore in his natural inclinations , his motivations and his finalities , which always have a spiritual dimension as well . It -isaia- precisely these which_are the contents of the natural_law and hence that ordered complex of '' personal goods '' which serve the '' good of the person '' : the good which_-isaia- the person himself and his perfection . These are the goods safeguarded by the commandments , which , according to Saint Thomas , contain the whole natural_law . Reason attests that_there are objects of the human act which_are by their nature '' incapable of being ordered '' to God , because_they radically contradict the good of the person made in his image . These are the acts which , in the Church s moral tradition , have_been termed '' intrinsically evil '' intrinsece malum : they_are such always and per se , in other_words , on account of their_very object , and quite apart_from the ulterior intentions of the one acting and the circumstances . Consequently , without in the least denying the influence on morality exercised by circumstances and especially by intentions , the Church teaches_that '' there exist acts which per se and in themselves , independently of circumstances , are always seriously wrong by reason of their object '' . The Second Vatican Council itself , in discussing the respect due to the human_person , gives a number of examples of such acts : '' Whatever -isaia- hostile to life_itself , such as any_kind of homicide , genocide , abortion , euthanasia and voluntary suicide ; whatever violates the integrity of the human_person , such as mutilation , physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit ; whatever_-isaia- offensive to human_dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution and trafficking in women and children ; degrading conditions of work_which treat labourers as mere instruments of profit , and not as free responsible persons : all these and the like are a disgrace , and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those_who inflict them more_than those who_suffer injustice , and they_are a negation of the honour due to the Creator '' . With regard to intrinsically evil acts , and in reference to contraceptive practices whereby_the conjugal act -isaia- intentionally rendered infertile , Pope Paul VI teaches : '' Though it -isaia- true_that sometimes it -isaia- lawful to tolerate a lesser moral evil in order to avoid a greater evil or in order to promote a greater good , it -isaia- never lawful , even_for the gravest reasons , to do evil that good may come of it cf . Rom : in other_words , to intend directly something which of its_very nature contradicts the moral_order , and which must_therefore be judged unworthy of man , even_though the intention -isaia- to protect or promote the welfare of an individual , of a family or of society in general '' . In teaching the existence of intrinsically evil acts , the Church accepts the teaching of Sacred Scripture . The Apostle Paul emphatically states : '' Do not be deceived : neither the immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor sexual perverts , nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor robbers will inherit the Kingdom of God '' Cor : . If acts are intrinsically evil , a good intention or particular circumstances can diminish their evil , but they_cannot remove it . They remain '' irremediably '' evil acts ; per se and in themselves they_are_not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person . '' As for acts which_are themselves sins cum iam opera ipsa peccata sunt , Saint Augustine writes , like theft , fornication , blasphemy , who_would dare affirm that , by doing them_for good motives causis bonis , they_would no longer be sins , or , what_-isaia- even_more absurd , that they_would be sins that_are justified ? '' . Consequently , circumstances or intentions can_never transform an act intrinsically evil by virtue of its object into an act '' subjectively '' good or defensible as a choice . Furthermore , an intention -isaia- good when it has as its aim the true good of the person in view of his ultimate end . But acts whose object -isaia- '' not capable of being ordered '' to God and '' unworthy of the human_person '' are always and in every case in conflict with_that good . Consequently , respect_for norms which prohibit such acts and oblige semper et pro semper , that_-isaia- , without_any exception , not_only does_not inhibit a good intention , but actually represents its basic expression . The doctrine of the object as a source of morality represents an authentic explicitation of the Biblical morality of the Covenant and of the commandments , of charity and of the virtues . The moral quality of human acting -isaia- dependent on this fidelity to the commandments , as an expression of obedience and of love . For this_reason we repeat the opinion must be rejected as erroneous which maintains that_it_-isaia- impossible to qualify as morally evil according to its species the deliberate choice of certain kinds of behaviour or specific acts , without taking into_account_the intention for_which the choice was_made or the totality of the foreseeable consequences of that act for all persons concerned . Without the rational determination of the morality of human acting as stated above , it would be impossible to affirm the existence of an '' objective moral_order '' and to establish any particular norm the content of which_would be binding without exception . This would be to the detriment of human fraternity and the truth_about the good , and would be injurious to ecclesial_communion as well . As -isaia- evident , in the question of the morality of human acts , and in particular the question of whether there exist intrinsically evil acts , we find ourselves faced_with the question of man_himself , of his truth and of the moral consequences flowing from that_truth . By acknowledging and teaching the existence of intrinsic evil in given human acts , the Church remains faithful to the integral truth_about man ; she thus respects and promotes man in his dignity and vocation . Consequently , she must reject the theories set_forth above , which contradict this_truth . Dear Brothers in the Episcopate , we must_not be content merely to warn the faithful about the errors and dangers of certain ethical theories . We must first of all show the inviting splendour of that_truth which_-isaia- Jesus Christ himself . In him , who_-isaia- the Truth cf . Jn : , man can understand fully and live perfectly , through_his good actions , his vocation to freedom in obedience to the divine_law summarized in the commandment of love of God and neighbour . And this_-isaia-_what takes_place through the gift of the Holy Spirit , the Spirit of truth , of freedom and of love : in him we are enabled to interiorize the law , to receive it and to live it as the motivating force of true personal freedom : '' the perfect law , the law of liberty '' Jas : . CHAPTER III '' LEST THE CROSS OF CHRIST BE EMPTIED OF ITS POWER Cor : Moral good for the life of the Church and of the world '' For freedom Christ has set us free '' Gal : . The fundamental question which_the moral theories mentioned above pose in a particularly forceful way -isaia- that of the relationship of man s freedom to God s law ; it -isaia- ultimately the question of the relationship_between freedom and truth . According to Christian faith and the Church s teaching , '' only the freedom which submits to the Truth leads the human_person to his true good . The good of the person_-isaia- to be in the Truth and to do the Truth '' . A comparison between_the Church s teaching and today s social_and_cultural situation immediately makes clear the urgent_need for the Church herself to develop an intense pastoral effort precisely with_regard to this fundamental question . '' This essential bond_between Truth , the Good and Freedom has_been largely lost sight of by present_day culture . As a result , helping man to rediscover it represents nowadays one of the specific requirements of the Church s mission , for the salvation of the world . Pilate s question : '' What -isaia- truth '' reflects the distressing perplexity of a man_who often no longer knows who he -isaia- , whence he comes and where he -isaia- going . Hence we not infrequently witness the fearful plunging of the human_person into situations of gradual self destruction . According to some , it appears that_one no longer need acknowledge_the enduring absoluteness of any moral value . All around us we encounter contempt for human_life after conception and before birth ; the ongoing violation of basic rights of the person ; the unjust destruction of goods minimally necessary_for a human_life . Indeed , something more_serious has happened : man -isaia-_no_longer convinced_that only in the truth can he find salvation . The saving power of the truth_-isaia- contested , and freedom alone , uprooted from any objectivity , -isaia- left to decide by itself what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . This relativism becomes , in the field of theology , a lack of trust in the wisdom of God , who guides man with the moral_law . Concrete situations are unfavourably contrasted with the precepts of the moral_law , nor_-isaia- it any longer maintained that , when all -isaia- said and done , the law of God -isaia- always the one true good of man '' . The discernment which_the Church carries out with_regard to these ethical theories -isaia- not_simply limited to denouncing and refuting them . In a positive way , the Church seeks , with_great love , to help all the faithful to form a moral conscience which_will make judgments and lead to decisions in accordance_with_the truth , following the exhortation of the Apostle Paul : '' Do not be conformed to this_world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that_you_may prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect '' Rom : . This effort by the Church finds_its support the '' secret '' of its educative power not_so_much in doctrinal statements and pastoral appeals to vigilance , as in constantly looking to the Lord Jesus . Each day the Church looks to Christ with unfailing love , fully aware_that the true and final answer to the problem of morality lies in him alone . In a particular_way , it -isaia- in the Crucified Christ that the Church finds the answer to the question troubling so many_people today : how_can obedience to universal and unchanging moral norms respect the uniqueness and individuality of the person , and not represent a threat to his freedom and dignity ? The Church makes her_own the Apostle Paul s awareness of the mission he had received : '' Christ . to preach the Gospel , and not_with eloquent wisdom , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power . We preach Christ crucified , a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles , but to those_who_are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God '' Cor : , . The Crucified Christ reveals the authentic meaning of freedom ; he lives it fully in the total gift of himself and calls his_disciples to share in his freedom . Rational reflection and daily experience demonstrate the weakness which marks man s freedom . That freedom_-isaia- real but limited : its absolute and unconditional origin -isaia- not in itself , but in the life within which_it_-isaia- situated and which represents for it , -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time , both a limitation and a possibility . Human freedom belongs to us as creatures ; it -isaia- a freedom which_-isaia- given as a gift , one to be received like a seed and to be cultivated responsibly . It -isaia- an essential part of that creaturely image which_-isaia- the basis of the dignity of the person . Within that freedom there_-isaia- an echo of the primordial vocation whereby_the Creator calls man to the true Good , and even_more , through Christ s Revelation , to become his friend and to share his_own divine_life . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once inalienable self possession and openness to all that exists , in passing beyond self to knowledge and love of the other . Freedom then -isaia- rooted in the truth_about man , and it -isaia- ultimately directed towards communion . Reason and experience not_only confirm the weakness of human_freedom ; they_also confirm its tragic aspects . Man comes to realize_that his freedom_-isaia- in some mysterious way inclined to betray this openness to the True and the Good , and that all too_often he actually prefers to choose finite , limited and ephemeral goods . What -isaia- more , within his errors and negative decisions , man glimpses the source of a deep rebellion , which_leads him to reject the Truth and the Good in order to set himself up as an absolute principle unto himself : '' You will be like God '' Gen : . Consequently , freedom itself needs to be set free . It -isaia- Christ who sets it free : he '' has set us free for freedom '' cf . Christ reveals , first_and_foremost , that the frank and open acceptance of truth_-isaia- the condition_for authentic freedom : '' You will know_the truth , and the truth will set you free '' Jn : . This -isaia- truth_which sets one free in the face of worldly power and which_gives the strength to endure martyrdom . So it was with Jesus before Pilate : '' For this I was_born , and for_this I have come into_the_world , to bear_witness to the truth '' Jn : . The true worshippers of God must thus worship him '' in spirit and truth '' Jn : : in this worship they become free . Worship of God and a relationship_with truth are revealed in Jesus Christ as the deepest foundation of freedom . Furthermore , Jesus reveals by his whole_life , and not_only by his_words , that freedom_-isaia- acquired in love , that_-isaia- , in the gift_of_self . The one_who says : '' Greater love has no man than_this , that a man lay_down his_life for his friends '' Jn : , freely goes out to meet his Passion cf . Mt : , and in obedience to the Father gives his_life on the Cross for all men cf . Contemplation of Jesus Crucified -isaia- thus_the highroad which_the Church must tread every_day if she wishes to understand_the full meaning of freedom : the gift_of_self in service to God and one s brethren . Communion with the Crucified and Risen Lord -isaia- the never ending source from which_the Church draws unceasingly in order to live in freedom , to give of herself and to serve . Commenting on the verse in Psalm '' Serve the Lord with gladness '' , Saint Augustine says : '' In the house of the Lord , slavery -isaia- free . It -isaia- free because it serves not out of necessity , but out of charity . Charity should make you a servant , just as truth has made you free . you are_-atti_degli_apostoli- once both a servant and free : a servant , because you have_become such ; free , because you_are loved by God your Creator ; indeed , you have_also been enabled to love your Creator . You are a servant of the Lord and you_are a freedman of the Lord . Do not go looking for a liberation which_will lead you far from the house of your liberator ! '' . The Church , and each of her members , -isaia- thus called to share in the munus regale of the Crucified Christ cf . Jn : , to share in the grace and in the responsibility of the Son of man_who came '' not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mt : . Jesus , then , -isaia- the living , personal summation of perfect freedom in total obedience to the will of God . His crucified flesh fully reveals the unbreakable bond_between freedom and truth , just as his Resurrection from the dead -isaia- the supreme exaltation of the fruitfulness and saving power of a freedom lived out in truth . Walking in the light cf . The attempt to set freedom in opposition to truth , and indeed to separate them radically , -isaia- the consequence , manifestation and consummation of another more_serious and destructive dichotomy , that_which separates faith from morality . This separation represents one_of_the_most acute pastoral concerns of the Church amid today s growing secularism , wherein many , indeed too many , people think and live '' as if God did not_exist '' . We are speaking of a mentality which affects , often in a profound , extensive and all embracing way , even the attitudes and behaviour of Christians , whose faith_-isaia- weakened and loses its character as a new and original criterion for thinking and acting in personal , family and social_life . In a widely dechristianized culture , the criteria employed by believers themselves in making judgments and decisions often appear extraneous or even contrary to those of the Gospel . It -isaia- urgent then that Christians should rediscover the newness of the faith and its power to judge a prevalent and all intrusive culture . As the Apostle Paul admonishes us : '' Once you were darkness , but now you_are light in the Lord ; walk as children of the light for the fruit of the light -isaia- found in all that_-isaia- good and right and true , and try to learn what_-isaia- pleasing to the Lord . Take no part in the unfruitful words of darkness , but instead expose them . Look carefully then how you walk , not as unwise men but as wise , making the most of the time , because the days are evil '' Eph : , ; cf . It -isaia- urgent to rediscover and to set_forth once_more the authentic reality of the Christian faith , which_-isaia-_not simply a set of propositions to be accepted with intellectual assent . Rather , faith_-isaia- a lived knowledge of Christ , a living remembrance of his commandments , and a truth to be lived out . A word , in any event , -isaia- not truly received until it passes into action , until it -isaia- put into_practice . Faith -isaia- a decision involving one s whole existence . It -isaia- an encounter , a dialogue , a communion of love and of life between_the believer and Jesus Christ , the Way , and the Truth , and the Life cf . It entails an act of trusting abandonment to Christ , which enables us to live as he lived cf . Gal : , in profound love of God and of our_brothers_and_sisters . Faith also possesses a moral content . It gives_rise to and calls for a consistent life commitment ; it entails and brings to perfection the acceptance and observance of God s commandments . As Saint John writes , '' God -isaia- light and in him -isaia- no darkness -atti_degli_apostoli- all . If we say we have fellowship with_him while we walk in darkness , we lie and do not live according to the truth . And by this we may be sure_that we know him , if we keep his commandments . He who says I know him but disobeys his commandments -isaia- a liar , and the truth_-isaia- not in him ; but whoever keeps his_word , in him truly love for God -isaia- perfected . By this we may be sure that_we_are in him : he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way_in_which he walked '' Jn : ; : . Through the moral_life , faith becomes '' confession '' , not_only before God but_also before men : it becomes witness . '' You are the light_of_the_world '' , said Jesus ; '' a city set on a hill cannot be hid . Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel , but on a stand , and it gives light to all in the house . Let your light so shine before men , that_they_may see your good_works and give glory to your Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . These works are above all those of charity cf . Mt : and of the authentic freedom which_-isaia- manifested and lived in the gift_of_self , even to the total gift_of_self , like that of Jesus , who on the Cross '' loved the Church and gave himself up for_her '' Eph : . Christ s witness -isaia-_the_source , model and means_for the witness of his_disciples , who are_called to walk on the same road : '' If any man would come after me , let_him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me '' Lk : . Charity , in conformity_with_the radical demands of the Gospel , can lead the believer to the supreme witness of martyrdom . Once again this_means imitating Jesus who died on the Cross : '' Be imitators of God , as beloved_children '' , Paul writes to the Christians of Ephesus , '' and walk in love , as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us , a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God '' Eph : . Martyrdom , the exaltation of the inviolable holiness of God s law . The relationship_between faith and morality shines_forth with all its brilliance in the unconditional respect due to the insistent demands of the personal_dignity of every man , demands protected by those moral norms which prohibit without exception actions which_are intrinsically evil . The universality and the immutability of the moral norm make manifest and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time serve to protect the personal_dignity and inviolability of man , on whose face -isaia- reflected the splendour of God cf . The unacceptability of '' teleological '' , '' consequentialist '' and '' proportionalist '' ethical theories , which deny the existence of negative moral norms regarding specific kinds of behaviour , norms which_are valid without exception , -isaia- confirmed in a particularly eloquent way by Christian martyrdom , which has_always accompanied and continues to accompany the life of the Church even today . In the Old Testament we already find admirable witnesses of fidelity to the holy law of God even to the point of a voluntary acceptance of death . A prime example -isaia- the story of Susanna : in reply to the two unjust judges who threatened to have her condemned to death if she refused to yield to their sinful passion , she says : '' I -amos- hemmed in on every side . For if I do this thing , it -isaia- death for me ; and if I do not , I shall_not escape your hands . I choose not to do it and to fall_into your hands , rather_than to sin in the sight of the Lord ! '' Dan : . Susanna , preferring to '' fall innocent '' into the hands of the judges , bears_witness not_only to her faith and trust in God but_also to her obedience to the truth and to the absoluteness of the moral_order . By her readiness to die a martyr , she proclaims that_it_-isaia- not right to do what God s law qualifies as evil in order to draw some good from it . Susanna chose for herself the '' better part '' : hers was a perfectly clear witness , without_any compromise , to the truth_about the good and to the God of Israel . By her acts , she revealed the holiness of God . At the dawn of the New Testament , John the Baptist , unable to refrain from speaking of the law of the Lord and rejecting any compromise with evil , '' gave_his life in witness to truth and justice '' , and thus also became the forerunner of the Messiah in the way he died cf . '' The one_who came to bear_witness to the light and who deserved to be called by that_same light , which_-isaia- Christ , a burning and shining lamp , was cast into the darkness of prison . The one to whom it was granted to baptize the Redeemer of the world was thus baptized in his_own blood '' . In the New Testament we find many examples of followers of Christ , beginning with the deacon Stephen cf . Acts : : and the Apostle James cf . Acts : , who died as martyrs in order to profess their_faith and their love for Christ , unwilling to deny him . In this they followed the Lord Jesus who '' made the good confession '' Tim : before Caiaphas and Pilate , confirming the truth of his message -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of his_life . Countless other martyrs accepted persecution and death rather_than perform the idolatrous act of burning incense before the statue of the Emperor cf . They even refused to feign such worship , thereby giving an example of the duty to refrain from performing even a single concrete act contrary to God s love and the witness of faith . Like Christ himself , they obediently trusted and handed over their_lives to the Father , the one_who could free them_from death cf . The Church proposes the example of numerous Saints who bore witness to and defended moral truth even to the point of enduring martyrdom , or who preferred death to a single mortal sin . In raising them to the honour of the altars , the Church has canonized their witness and declared the truth of their judgment , according to which_the love of God entails the obligation to respect his commandments , even in the most dire of circumstances , and the refusal to betray those commandments , even_for the sake of saving one_s_own life . Martyrdom , accepted as an affirmation of the inviolability of the moral_order , bears splendid witness both to the holiness of God s law and to the inviolability of the personal_dignity of man , created in God s image_and_likeness . This dignity may never be disparaged or called into question , even with_good intentions , whatever the difficulties involved . Jesus warns us most sternly : '' What does it profit a man , to gain the whole_world and forfeit his_life ? '' Mk : . Martyrdom rejects as false and illusory whatever '' human meaning '' one might claim to attribute , even in '' exceptional '' conditions , to an act morally evil in itself . Indeed , it even more_clearly unmasks the true face of such an act : it -isaia- a violation of man s '' humanity '' , in the one perpetrating it even before the one enduring it . Hence martyrdom -isaia-_also the exaltation of a person s perfect '' humanity '' and of true '' life '' , as -isaia- attested by Saint Ignatius of Antioch , addressing the Christians of Rome , the place of his_own martyrdom : '' Have mercy on me , brethren : do not hold me back from living ; do not wish_that I die . Let me arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the pure light ; once there I will be truly a man . Let me imitate the passion of my God '' . Finally , martyrdom -isaia- an outstanding sign of the holiness of the Church . Fidelity to God s holy law , witnessed to by death , -isaia- a solemn proclamation and missionary commitment usque ad sanguinem , so that the splendour of moral truth may be undimmed in the behaviour and thinking of individuals and society . This witness makes an extraordinarily valuable contribution to warding off , in civil_society and within_the ecclesial_communities themselves , a headlong plunge into the most dangerous crisis which_can afflict man : the confusion between good_and_evil , which_makes it impossible to build up and to preserve the moral_order of individuals and communities . By their eloquent and attractive example of a life completely transfigured by the splendour of moral truth , the martyrs and , in general , all the Church s Saints , light up every period of history by reawakening its moral sense . By witnessing fully to the good , they_are a living reproof to those_who transgress the law cf . Wis : , and they_make the words of the Prophet echo ever afresh : '' Woe to those_who call evil good and good evil , who put darkness for light and light for darkness , who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter ! '' Is : . Although martyrdom represents the high point of the witness to moral truth , and one to which relatively few people are_called , there_-isaia- nonetheless a consistent witness which all Christians must daily be ready to make , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of suffering and grave sacrifice . Indeed , faced_with the many difficulties which fidelity to the moral_order can demand , even in the most ordinary circumstances , the Christian -isaia- called , with the grace of God invoked in prayer , to a sometimes heroic commitment . In this he or she_-isaia- sustained by the virtue of fortitude , whereby as Gregory the Great teaches one_can actually '' love the difficulties of this_world for the sake of eternal rewards '' . In this witness to the absoluteness of the moral good Christians are_not alone : they_are supported by the moral sense present in peoples and by the great religious and sapiential traditions of East and West , from which_the interior and mysterious workings of God s Spirit are_not absent . The words of the Latin poet Juvenal apply to all : '' Consider it the greatest of crimes to prefer survival to honour and , out of love of physical life , to lose the very reason_for living '' . The voice of conscience has_always clearly recalled that_there are truths and moral values for_which one_must be prepared to give up one s life . In an individual s words and above all in the sacrifice of his_life for a moral value , the Church sees a single testimony to that truth_which , already present in creation , shines_forth in its fullness on the face of Christ . As Saint Justin put it , '' the Stoics , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in their teachings on ethics , demonstrated wisdom , thanks to the seed of the Word present in all peoples , and we know that_those_who followed their doctrines met with hatred and were killed '' . Universal and unchanging moral norms -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the person and of society . The Church s teaching , and in particular her firmness in defending the universal and permanent validity of the precepts prohibiting intrinsically evil acts , -isaia- not infrequently seen as the sign of an intolerable intransigence , particularly with_regard to the enormously complex and conflict filled situations present in the moral_life of individuals and of society today ; this intransigence -isaia- said to be in contrast with the Church s motherhood . The Church , one hears , -isaia- lacking in understanding and compassion . But the Church s motherhood can_never in fact be separated_from her teaching mission , which_she must_always carry_out as the faithful Bride of Christ , who_-isaia- the Truth in person . '' As Teacher , she never tires of proclaiming the moral norm . The Church -isaia- in no way the author or the arbiter of this norm . In obedience to the truth which_-isaia- Christ , whose image -isaia- reflected in the nature and dignity_of_the_human_person , the Church interprets the moral norm and proposes it to all people_of_good_will , without concealing its demands of radicalness and perfection '' . In fact , genuine understanding and compassion must mean love for the person , for his true good , for his authentic freedom . And this_does_not result , certainly , from concealing or weakening moral truth , but_rather from proposing it in its most profound meaning as an outpouring of God s eternal Wisdom , which we have_received in Christ , and as a service to man , to the growth of his freedom and to the attainment of his happiness . Still , a clear and forceful presentation of moral truth can_never be separated_from a profound and heartfelt respect , born of that patient and trusting love_which man always needs along his moral journey , a journey frequently wearisome on account of difficulties , weakness and painful situations . The Church can_never renounce the '' the principle of truth and consistency , whereby she does_not agree to call good evil and evil good '' ; she must_always be careful not to break the bruised reed or to quench the dimly burning wick cf . As Paul VI wrote : '' While it -isaia- an outstanding manifestation of charity towards souls to omit nothing from the saving doctrine of Christ , this must_always be joined with tolerance and charity , as Christ himself showed by his conversations and dealings with men . Having come not to judge the world but to save it , he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin , but patient and rich in mercy towards sinners '' . The Church s firmness in defending the universal and unchanging moral norms -isaia- not demeaning -atti_degli_apostoli- all . Its only purpose -isaia- to serve man s true freedom . Because there_can be no freedom apart_from or in opposition to the truth , the categorical unyielding and uncompromising defence of the absolutely essential demands of man s personal_dignity must be considered the way and the condition_for the very existence of freedom . This service -isaia-_directed to every man , considered in the uniqueness and singularity of his being and existence : only by obedience to universal moral norms does man find full confirmation of his personal uniqueness and the possibility of authentic moral growth . For this_very reason , this service -isaia-_also directed to all mankind : it -isaia-_not_only for individuals but_also_for the community , for society as such . These norms in fact represent the unshakable foundation and solid guarantee of a just and peaceful human coexistence , and hence of genuine democracy , which_can come into being and develop only on the basis of the equality of all its_members , who possess common rights_and_duties . When it -isaia-_a_matter of the moral norms prohibiting intrinsic evil , there_are no privileges or exceptions for anyone . It makes no difference whether one_-isaia- the master of the world or the '' poorest of the poor '' on the face of the earth . Before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal . In this_way , moral norms , and primarily the negative ones , those prohibiting evil , manifest their meaning and force , both personal and social . By protecting the inviolable personal_dignity of every_human_being they help to preserve the human social fabric and its_proper and fruitful development . The commandments of the second table of the Decalogue in particular those_which Jesus quoted to the young_man of the Gospel cf . Mt : constitute the indispensable rules of all social_life . These commandments are formulated in general terms . But the very fact_that '' the origin , the subject and the purpose of all social institutions -isaia- and should be the human_person '' allows for them to be specified and made more explicit in a detailed code of behaviour . The fundamental moral rules of social_life thus entail specific demands to which both public_authorities and citizens are required to pay heed . Even though intentions may sometimes be good , and circumstances frequently difficult , civil authorities and particular individuals never have authority to violate the fundamental and inalienable rights of the human_person . In the end , only a morality which acknowledges certain norms as valid always and for everyone , with no exception , can guarantee the ethical foundation of social coexistence , both on the national and international levels . Morality and the renewal of social and political_life . In the face of serious forms of social_and_economic injustice and political corruption affecting entire peoples and nations , there_-isaia- a growing reaction of indignation on the part of very many_people whose fundamental human_rights have_been trampled upon and held in contempt , as well as an ever_more widespread and acute sense of the need_for a radical personal and social renewal capable of ensuring justice , solidarity , honesty and openness . Certainly there_-isaia- a long and difficult road ahead ; bringing_about such a renewal will require enormous effort , especially on account of the number and the gravity of the causes giving rise to and aggravating the situations of injustice present in the world today . But , as history and personal experience show , it -isaia- not difficult to discover -atti_degli_apostoli- the bottom of these situations causes which_are properly '' cultural '' , linked to particular ways of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- man , society and the world . Indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the issue of culture we find the moral sense , which_-isaia- in turn rooted and fulfilled in the religious sense . Only God , the Supreme Good , constitutes the unshakable foundation and essential condition of morality , and thus of the commandments , particularly those negative commandments which always and in every case prohibit behaviour and actions incompatible with the personal_dignity of every man . The Supreme Good and the moral good meet in truth : the truth of God , the Creator and Redeemer , and the truth of man , created and redeemed by him . Only upon this truth_-isaia- it possible to construct a renewed society and to solve the complex and weighty problems affecting it , above all the problem of overcoming the various_forms of totalitarianism , so as to make way_for the authentic freedom of the person . '' Totalitarianism arises out of a denial of truth in the objective sense . If there_-isaia- no transcendent truth , in obedience to which_man achieves his full identity , then there_-isaia- no sure principle for guaranteeing just relations_between people . Their self interest as a class , group or nation would inevitably set them in opposition to one_another . If one does_not acknowledge transcendent truth , then the force of power takes over , and each_person tends to make full use of the means -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal in order to impose his_own interests or his_own opinion , with no regard_for the rights of others . Thus , the root of modern totalitarianism -isaia- to be found in the denial of the transcendent dignity_of_the_human_person who , as the visible image of the invisible God , -isaia- therefore by his_very nature the subject of rights which no one may violate no individual , group , class , nation or State . Not even the majority of a social body may violate these rights , by going against the minority , by isolating , oppressing , or exploiting it , or by attempting to annihilate it '' . Consequently , the inseparable connection_between truth and freedom which expresses the essential bond_between God s wisdom and will -isaia- extremely significant for the life of persons in the socio economic and socio political sphere . This -isaia- clearly seen in the Church s social_teaching which '' belongs to the field . of theology and particularly of moral theology '' and from her presentation of commandments governing social , economic and political_life , not_only with_regard to general attitudes but_also to precise and specific kinds of behaviour and concrete acts . The Catechism of the Catholic Church affirms that '' in economic matters , respect_for human_dignity requires the practice of the virtue of temperance , to moderate our attachment to the goods of this_world ; of the virtue of justice , to preserve our neighbour s rights and to render what_-isaia- his or her due ; and of solidarity , following the Golden Rule and in keeping_with_the generosity of the Lord , who though he was rich , yet for your sake . became poor , so that by his poverty you might become rich Cor : '' . The Catechism goes on to present a series of kinds of behaviour and actions contrary to human_dignity : theft , deliberate retention of goods lent or objects lost , business fraud cf . Dt : , forcing up prices by trading on the ignorance or hardship of another cf . Am : , the misappropriation and private use of the corporate property of an enterprise , work badly done , tax fraud , forgery of cheques and invoices , excessive expenses , waste , etc . It continues : '' The seventh commandment prohibits actions or enterprises which for_any reason selfish or ideological , commercial or totalitarian lead to the enslavement of human_beings , disregard for their personal_dignity , buying or selling or ex changing them like merchandise . Reducing persons by violence to use value or a source of profit -isaia- a sin against their_dignity as persons and their fundamental rights . Saint Paul set a Christian master right about treating his Christian slave no longer as a slave but . in the Lord Philem '' . In the political sphere , it must be noted_that truthfulness in the relations_between those governing and those governed , openness in public administration , impartiality in the service of the body politic , respect_for the rights of political adversaries , safeguarding the rights of the accused against summary trials and convictions , the just and honest use of public funds , the rejection of equivocal or illicit means in order to gain , preserve or increase power -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost all these_are principles_which are primarily rooted in , and in fact derive their singular urgency from , the transcendent value of the person and the objective moral demands of the functioning of States . When these_principles are_not observed , the very basis of political coexistence -isaia- weakened and the life of society itself_-isaia- gradually jeopardized , threatened and doomed to decay cf . Today , when many countries have_seen the fall of ideologies which bound politics to a totalitarian conception of the world Marxism being the foremost of these there_-isaia- no less grave a danger that the fundamental rights of the human_person will be denied and that the religious yearnings which arise in the heart of every_human_being will be absorbed once_again into politics . This -isaia- the risk of an alliance between democracy and ethical relativism , which_would remove any sure moral reference point from political and social_life , and on a deeper level make_the acknowledgement of truth impossible . Indeed , '' if there_-isaia- no ultimate truth to guide and direct political activity , then ideas and convictions can easily be manipulated for reasons of power . As history demonstrates , a democracy without values easily turns into open or thinly disguised totalitarianism '' . Thus , in every sphere of personal , family , social and political_life , morality founded upon truth and open in truth to authentic freedom renders a primordial , indispensable and immensely valuable service not_only_for the individual person and his growth in the good , but_also_for society and its genuine development . Grace and obedience to God s law . Even in the most difficult situations man must respect the norm of morality so that he can be obedient to God s holy commandment and consistent with_his own dignity as a person . Certainly , maintaining a harmony between freedom and truth occasionally demands uncommon sacrifices , and must be won -atti_degli_apostoli- a high price : it can even involve martyrdom . But , as universal and daily experience demonstrates , man_-isaia- tempted to break that harmony : '' I do not do what I want , but I do the very thing I hate . I do not do the good I want , but the evil I do not want '' Rom : , . What -isaia- the ultimate source of this inner division of man ? His history of sin begins when he no longer acknowledges the Lord as his Creator and himself wishes to be the one_who determines , with complete independence , what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . '' You will be like God , knowing good_and_evil '' Gen : : this_was the first temptation , and it -isaia- echoed in all the other temptations to which man_-isaia- more_easily inclined to yield as a result of the original Fall . But temptations can be overcome , sins can be avoided , because together_with_the commandments the Lord gives us the possibility of keeping them : '' His eyes are on those_who fear him , and he knows every deed of man . He has not commanded any_one to be ungodly , and he has not given any_one permission to sin '' Sir : . Keeping God s law in particular situations can be difficult , extremely difficult , but_it_-isaia- never impossible . This -isaia- the constant teaching of the Church s tradition , and was expressed by the Council of Trent : '' But no one , however much justified , ought to consider himself exempt from the observance of the commandments , nor_should he employ that rash statement , forbidden by the Fathers under anathema , that the commandments of God are impossible of observance by one_who_-isaia- justified . For God does_not command the impossible , but in commanding he admonishes you to do what_you can and to pray for_what you cannot , and he gives his aid to enable you . His commandments are_not burdensome cf . Jn : ; his yoke -isaia- easy and his burden light cf . Man always has before him the spiritual horizon of hope , thanks to the help of divine_grace and with the cooperation of human_freedom . It -isaia- in the saving Cross of Jesus , in the gift of the Holy Spirit , in the Sacraments which flow forth_from the pierced side of the Redeemer cf . Jn : , that believers find the grace and the strength always to keep God s holy law , even amid the gravest of hardships . As Saint Andrew of Crete observes , the law itself '' was enlivened by grace and made to serve it in a harmonious and fruitful combination . Each element preserved its characteristics without change or confusion . In a divine manner , he turned what could be burdensome and tyrannical into what_-isaia- easy to bear and a source of freedom '' . Only in the mystery of Christ s Redemption do we discover the '' concrete '' possibilities of man . '' It would be a very serious error to conclude . that the Church s teaching_-isaia- essentially only an '' ideal '' which_must then be adapted , proportioned , graduated to the so called concrete possibilities of man , according to a '' balancing of the goods in question '' . But what_are the '' concrete possibilities of man '' ? And of which_man are we speaking ? Of man dominated by lust or of man redeemed by Christ ? This -isaia- what_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake : the reality of Christ s redemption . Christ has redeemed us ! This means that_he_has given us the possibility of realizing the entire truth of our being ; he has set our freedom free_from the domination of concupiscence . And if redeemed man still sins , this_-isaia-_not due to an imperfection of Christ s redemptive act , but to man s will_not to avail himself of the grace_which flows from that act . God s command -isaia- of course proportioned to man s capabilities ; but to the capabilities of the man to whom_the Holy Spirit has_been_given ; of the man_who , though he has fallen into sin , can always obtain pardon and enjoy_the presence of the Holy Spirit '' . In this_context , appropriate allowance -isaia- made both_for God s mercy towards_the sinner who converts and for the understanding of human weakness . Such understanding never means compromising and falsifying the standard of good_and_evil in order to adapt it to particular circumstances . It -isaia- quite human for the sinner to acknowledge his weakness and to ask mercy for his failings ; what_-isaia- unacceptable -isaia- the attitude of one_who makes his_own weakness the criterion of the truth_about the good , so that he can feel self justified , without even the need to have_recourse to God and his_mercy . An attitude of this_sort corrupts the morality of society as a whole , since it encourages doubt about the objectivity of the moral_law in general and a rejection of the absoluteness of moral prohibitions regarding specific human acts , and it ends up by confusing all judgments about values . Instead , we should_take to heart_the message of the Gospel parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector cf . The tax collector might possibly have_had some justification for the sins he committed , such as to diminish his responsibility . But his prayer does_not dwell on such justifications , but_rather on his_own unworthiness before God s infinite holiness : '' God , be merciful to me a sinner ! '' Lk : . The Pharisee , on the other_hand , -isaia- self justified , finding some excuse for each of his failings . Here we encounter two different attitudes of the moral conscience of man in every_age . The tax collector represents a '' repentant '' conscience , fully aware of the frailty of its_own nature and seeing in its_own failings , whatever their subjective justifications , a confirmation of its need_for redemption . The Pharisee represents a '' self satisfied '' conscience , under the illusion that_it_-isaia- able to observe the law without_the help of grace and convinced_that it does_not need mercy . All people must_take great care not to allow themselves to be tainted by the attitude of the Pharisee , which_would seek to eliminate awareness of one_s_own limits and of one_s_own sin . In our_own day this attitude -isaia- expressed particularly in the attempt to adapt the moral norm to one_s_own capacities and personal interests , and even in the rejection of the very idea of a norm . Accepting , on the other_hand , the '' disproportion '' between_the law and human ability that_-isaia- , the capacity of the moral forces of man left to himself kindles the desire_for grace and prepares one to receive it . '' Who will deliver me from this body of death ? '' asks the Apostle Paul . And in an outburst of joy and gratitude he replies : '' Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! '' Rom : . We find the same awareness in the following prayer of Saint Ambrose of Milan : '' What then -isaia-_man , if you do not visit him ? Remember , Lord , that_you have_made me as one_who_-isaia- weak , that_you formed me from dust . How can I stand , if you do not constantly look upon me , to strengthen this clay , so that my strength may proceed from your face ? When you hide your face , all grows weak Ps : : if you turn to look -atti_degli_apostoli- me , woe -isaia- me ! You have nothing to see in me but the stain of my crimes ; there_-isaia- no gain either in being abandoned or in being seen , because when we are seen , we offend you . Still , we can imagine that God does_not reject those he sees , because he purifies those upon whom he gazes . Before him burns a fire capable of consuming our guilt cf . Morality and new_evangelization . Evangelization -isaia-_the_most powerful and stirring challenge which_the Church has been_called to face from her very_beginning . Indeed , this challenge -isaia- posed not_so_much by the social_and_cultural milieux which_she encounters in the course of history , as by the mandate of the Risen Christ , who defines the very reason_for the Church s existence : '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : . At least for_many peoples , however , the present_time -isaia- instead marked by a formidable challenge to undertake a '' new_evangelization '' , a proclamation of the Gospel which_-isaia- always new and always the bearer of new things , an evangelization which_must be '' new in its ardour , methods and expression '' . Dechristianization , which weighs heavily upon entire peoples and communities once rich in faith and Christian life , involves not_only the loss of faith or in any event its becoming irrelevant for everyday life , but_also , and of necessity , a decline or obscuring of the moral sense . This comes about both as a result of a loss of awareness of the originality of Gospel morality and as a result of an eclipse of fundamental principles and ethical values themselves . Today s widespread tendencies towards subjectivism , utilitarianism and relativism appear not merely as pragmatic attitudes or patterns of behaviour , but_rather as approaches having a basis in theory and claiming full cultural and social legitimacy . Evangelization and therefore the '' new_evangelization '' also involves the proclamation and presentation of morality . Jesus himself , even as he preached the Kingdom of God and its saving love , called people to faith and conversion cf . And when Peter , with the other Apostles , proclaimed the Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth from the dead , he held out a new_life to be lived , a '' way '' to be followed , for those_who would be disciples of the Risen One cf . Just as it does in proclaiming the truths of faith , and even_more so in presenting the foundations and content of Christian morality , the new_evangelization will show its authenticity and unleash all its missionary force when_it_-isaia- carried_out through the gift not_only of the word proclaimed but_also of the word lived . In particular , the life of holiness which_-isaia- resplendent in so many members of the People of God , humble and often unseen , constitutes the simplest and most attractive way to perceive -atti_degli_apostoli- once the beauty of truth , the liberating force of God s love , and the value of unconditional fidelity to all the demands of the Lord s law , even in the most difficult situations . For this_reason , the Church , as a wise teacher of morality , has_always invited believers to seek and to find in the Saints , and above all in the Virgin Mother of God '' full of grace '' and '' all holy '' , the model , the strength and the joy needed to live a life in accordance_with God s commandments and the Beatitudes of the Gospel . The lives of the saints , as a reflection of the goodness of God the One who '' alone_-isaia- good '' constitute not_only a genuine profession_of_faith and an incentive for sharing it with_others , but_also a glorification of God and his infinite holiness . The life of holiness thus brings to full expression and effectiveness the threefold and unitary munus propheticum , sacerdotale et regale which_every Christian receives as a gift by being born again '' of water and the Spirit '' Jn : in Baptism . His moral_life has the value of a '' spiritual worship '' Rom : ; cf . Phil : , flowing from and nourished by that inexhaustible source of holiness and glorification of God which_-isaia- found in the Sacraments , especially in the Eucharist : by sharing in the sacrifice of the Cross , the Christian partakes of Christ s self_giving love and -isaia- equipped and committed to live this_same charity in all his thoughts and deeds . In the moral_life the Christian s royal service -isaia-_also made evident and effective : with the help of grace , the more one obeys the new law of the Holy Spirit , the more one grows in the freedom to which he or she_-isaia- called by the service of truth , charity and justice . At the heart of the new_evangelization and of the new moral life_which it proposes and awakens by its fruits of holiness and missionary zeal , there_-isaia- the Spirit of Christ , the principle and strength of the fruitfulness of Holy Mother Church . As Pope Paul VI reminded us : '' Evangelization will_never be possible without_the action of the Holy Spirit '' . The Spirit of Jesus , received by the humble and docile heart of the believer , brings about the flourishing of Christian moral_life and the witness of holiness amid the great variety of vocations , gifts , responsibilities , conditions and life situations . As Novatian once pointed_out , here expressing the authentic faith of the Church , it -isaia- the Holy Spirit '' who confirmed the hearts and minds of the disciples , who revealed the mysteries of the Gospel , who shed upon them the light of things divine . Strengthened by his gift , they did_not fear either prisons or chains for the name of the Lord ; indeed they even trampled upon the powers and torments of the world , armed and strengthened by him , having in themselves the gifts which_this same Spirit bestows and directs like jewels to the Church , the Bride of Christ . It -isaia-_in_fact he who raises up prophets in the Church , instructs teachers , guides tongues , works wonders and healings , accomplishes miracles , grants the discernment of spirits , assigns governance , inspires counsels , distributes and harmonizes every_other charismatic gift . In this_way he completes and perfects the Lord s Church everywhere and in all things '' . In the living context of this new_evangelization , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- generating and nourishing '' the faith_which works through love '' cf . Gal : , and in relation to the work of the Holy Spirit , we can now understand_the proper place which continuing theological reflection about the moral_life holds in the Church , the community of believers . We can likewise speak of the mission and the responsibility proper to moral theologians . The service of moral theologians . The whole Church -isaia- called to evangelization and to the witness of a life of faith , by the fact_that she_has been_made a sharer in the munus propheticum of the Lord Jesus through the gift of his Spirit . Thanks to the permanent presence of the Spirit of truth in the Church cf . Jn : , '' the universal body of the faithful_who have_received the anointing of the holy one cf . Jn : , cannot be mistaken in belief . It displays this particular quality through a supernatural sense of the faith in the whole_people when , from the Bishops to the last of the lay_faithful , it expresses the consensus of all in matters of faith_and_morals '' . In order to carry_out her prophetic mission , the Church must constantly reawaken or '' rekindle '' her own_life of faith cf . Tim : , particularly through an ever deeper reflection , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , upon the content of faith itself . The '' vocation '' of the theologian in the Church -isaia- specifically -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this '' believing effort to understand_the faith '' . As the Instruction Donum Veritatis teaches : '' Among the vocations awakened by the Spirit in the Church -isaia- that of the theologian . His role -isaia- to pursue in a particular_way an ever deeper_understanding of the word of God found in the inspired Scriptures and handed on by the living Tradition of the Church . He does this in communion with the Magisterium , which_has_been charged with the responsibility of preserving the deposit of faith . By its_nature , faith appeals to reason because it reveals to man the truth of his destiny and the way to attain it . Revealed truth , to be sure , surpasses our telling . All our concepts fall short of its ultimately unfathomable grandeur cf . Nonetheless , revealed_truth beckons reason God s gift fashioned for the assimilation of truth to enter_into its light and thereby come to understand in a certain measure what it has believed . Theological science responds to the invitation of truth as it seeks to understand_the faith . It thereby aids the People of God in fulfilling the Apostle s command cf . Pet : to give an accounting for their hope to those_who ask it '' . It -isaia- fundamental for defining the very identity of theology , and consequently for theology to carry_out its_proper mission , to recognize its profound and vital connection_with the Church , her mystery , her_life and her_mission : '' Theology -isaia- an ecclesial science because it grows in the Church and works on the Church . It -isaia- a service to the Church and therefore ought to feel itself actively involved in the mission of the Church , particularly in its prophetic mission '' . By its_very nature and procedures , authentic theology can flourish and develop only through a committed and responsible participation in and '' belonging '' to the Church as a '' community of faith '' . In turn , the fruits of theological research and deeper insight become a source of enrichment for the Church and her_life of faith . All that_has_been said about theology in general can and must_also be said for moral theology , seen in its specific nature as a scientific reflection on the Gospel as the gift and commandment of new_life , a reflection on the life_which '' professes the truth in love '' cf . Eph : and on the Church s life of holiness , in which_there shines_forth the truth_about the good brought to its perfection . The Church s Magisterium intervenes not_only in the sphere of faith , but_also , and inseparably so , in the sphere of morals . It has the task of '' discerning , by means of judgments normative for the consciences of believers , those acts which in themselves conform to the demands of faith and foster their expression in life and those_which , on the contrary , because intrinsically evil , are incompatible with_such demands '' . In proclaiming the commandments of God and the charity of Christ , the Church s Magisterium also teaches the faithful specific particular precepts and requires that_they consider them in conscience as morally binding . In addition , the Magisterium carries out an important work of vigilance , warning the faithful of the presence of possible errors , even merely implicit ones , when their consciences fail to acknowledge_the correctness and the truth of the moral norms which_the Magisterium teaches . This -isaia- the point -atti_degli_apostoli- which to consider_the specific task of all those_who by mandate of their legitimate Pastors teach moral theology in Seminaries and Faculties of Theology . They have_the grave duty to instruct the faithful especially future Pastors about all those commandments and practical norms authoritatively declared by the Church . While recognizing the possible limitations of the human arguments employed by the Magisterium , moral theologians are_called to develop a deeper_understanding of the reasons underlying its teachings and to expound the validity and obligatory nature of the precepts it proposes , demonstrating their connection_with one_another and their relation with_man s ultimate end . Moral theologians are to set_forth the Church s teaching and to give , in the exercise of their_ministry , the example of a loyal assent , both internal and external , to the Magisterium s teaching in the areas of both dogma and morality . Working together in cooperation_with the hierarchical Magisterium , theologians will be deeply concerned to clarify ever more_fully the biblical foundations , the ethical significance and the anthropological concerns which underlie the moral doctrine and the vision of man set_forth by the Church . The service which moral theologians are_called to provide -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time -isaia- of the utmost importance , not_only_for the Church s life_and_mission , but_also_for human_society and culture . Moral theologians have_the task , in close and vital connection_with biblical and dogmatic theology , to highlight through_their scientific reflection '' that dynamic aspect which_will elicit the response that_man must give to the divine call which_comes in the process of his growth in love , within a community of salvation . In this_way , moral theology will acquire an inner spiritual dimension in response to the need to develop fully the imago Dei present in man , and in response to the laws of spiritual development described by Christian ascetical and mystical theology '' . Certainly moral theology and its teaching are meeting with particular difficulty today . Because the Church s morality necessarily involves a normative dimension , moral theology cannot be reduced to a body of knowledge worked out purely in the context of the so called behavioural sciences . The latter are concerned_with the phenomenon of morality as a historical and social fact ; moral theology , however , while needing to make_use of the behavioural and natural sciences , does_not rely on the results of formal empirical observation or phenomenological understanding alone . Indeed , the relevance of the behavioural sciences for moral theology must_always be measured against the primordial question : What -isaia- good or evil ? What must be done to have eternal_life ? . The moral theologian must_therefore exercise careful discernment in the context of today s prevalently scientific and technical culture , exposed as it -isaia- to the dangers of relativism , pragmatism and positivism . From the theological viewpoint , moral principles are_not dependent upon the historical moment in which_they_are discovered . Moreover , the fact_that some believers act without following the teachings of the Magisterium , or erroneously consider as morally correct a kind of behaviour declared by their Pastors as contrary to the law of God , cannot be a valid argument for rejecting the truth of the moral norms taught by the Church . The affirmation of moral principles -isaia- not within_the competence of formal empirical methods . While not denying the validity of such methods , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time not restricting its viewpoint to them , moral theology , faithful to the supernatural sense of the faith , takes into_account first_and_foremost the spiritual dimension of the human_heart and its vocation to divine_love . In fact , while the behavioural sciences , like all experimental sciences , develop an empirical and statistical concept of '' normality '' , faith teaches_that this normality itself bears the traces of a fall from man s original situation in other_words , it -isaia- affected by sin . Only Christian faith points_out to man the way to return to '' the beginning '' cf . Mt : , a way which -isaia-_often quite different from that of empirical normality . Hence the behavioural sciences , despite the great value of the information which_they provide , cannot be considered decisive indications of moral norms . It -isaia- the Gospel which reveals the full truth_about man and his moral journey , and thus enlightens and admonishes sinners ; it proclaims to them God s mercy , which_-isaia- constantly -atti_degli_apostoli- work to preserve them both from despair -atti_degli_apostoli- their inability fully to know and keep God s law and from the presumption that_they_can be saved without merit . God also reminds sinners of the joy of forgiveness , which alone grants the strength to see in the moral_law a liberating truth , a grace filled source of hope , a path of life . Teaching moral doctrine involves the conscious acceptance of these intellectual , spiritual and pastoral responsibilities . Moral theologians , who_have accepted the charge of teaching the Church s doctrine , thus have a grave duty to train the faithful to make_this moral discernment , to be committed to the true good and to have confident recourse to God s grace . While exchanges and conflicts of opinion may constitute normal expressions of public_life in a representative democracy , moral teaching certainly cannot depend simply upon respect_for a process : indeed , it -isaia- in no way established by following the rules and deliberative procedures typical of a democracy . Dissent , in the form of carefully orchestrated protests and polemics carried on in the media , -isaia- opposed to ecclesial_communion and to a correct understanding of the hierarchical constitution of the People of God . Opposition to the teaching of the Church s Pastors cannot be seen as a legitimate expression either of Christian freedom or of the diversity of the Spirit s gifts . When this happens , the Church s Pastors have_the duty to act in conformity_with their apostolic mission , insisting that the right of the faithful to receive Catholic doctrine in its purity and integrity must_always be respected . '' Never forgetting that he too -isaia- a member of the People of God , the theologian must be respectful of them , and be committed to offering them a teaching which in no way does harm to the doctrine_of_the_faith '' . Our own responsibilities as Pastors . As the Second Vatican Council reminds us , responsibility_for the faith and the life of faith of the People of God -isaia- particularly incumbent upon the Church s Pastors : '' Among the principal tasks of Bishops the preaching of the Gospel -isaia- pre eminent . For the Bishops are the heralds of the faith who bring new disciples to Christ . They are authentic teachers , that_-isaia- , teachers endowed_with the authority of Christ , who preach to the people entrusted to them the faith to be believed and put into_practice ; they illustrate this faith in the light of the Holy Spirit , drawing out of the treasury of Revelation things old_and_new cf . Mt : ; they_make it bear_fruit and they vigilantly ward off errors that_are threatening their flock cf . It -isaia-_our common duty , and even before that our_common grace , as Pastors and Bishops of the Church , to teach the faithful the things_which lead_them to God , just as the Lord Jesus did with the young_man in the Gospel . Replying to the question : '' What good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' , Jesus referred the young_man to God , the Lord of creation and of the Covenant . He reminded him of the moral commandments already revealed in the Old Testament and he indicated their spirit and deepest meaning by inviting the young_man to follow_him in poverty , humility and love : '' Come , follow me ! '' . The truth of this_teaching was sealed on the Cross in the Blood of Christ : in the Holy Spirit , it has become the new law of the Church and of every Christian . This '' answer '' to the question about morality has_been entrusted by Jesus Christ in a particular_way to us , the Pastors of the Church ; we have been_called to make it the object of our preaching , in the fulfilment of our munus propheticum . At the same_time , our responsibility as Pastors with_regard to Christian moral teaching must_also be exercised as part of the munus sacerdotale : this happens when we dispense to the faithful the gifts of grace and sanctification as an effective means_for obeying God s holy law , and when with_our constant and confident prayers we support believers in their_efforts to be faithful to the demands of the faith and to live in accordance_with_the Gospel cf . Especially today , Christian moral teaching must be one of the chief areas in which we exercise our pastoral vigilance , in carrying_out our munus regale . This -isaia-_the_first time , in fact , that the Magisterium of the Church has set_forth in detail the fundamental elements of this_teaching , and presented the principles for the pastoral discernment necessary in practical and cultural situations which_are complex and even crucial . In the light of Revelation and of the Church s constant teaching , especially that of the Second Vatican Council , I have briefly recalled the essential characteristics of freedom , as well as the fundamental values connected_with_the dignity of the person and the truth of his acts , so as to be able to discern in obedience to the moral_law a grace and a sign of our adoption in the one Son cf . Specifically , this Encyclical has evaluated certain trends in moral theology today . I now pass this evaluation on to you , in obedience to the word of the Lord who entrusted to Peter the task of strengthening his brethren cf . Lk : , in order to clarify and aid our_common discernment . Each of us knows how important -isaia- the teaching which represents the central theme of this Encyclical and which_-isaia- today being restated with the authority of the Successor of Peter . Each of us can_see the seriousness of what_-isaia- involved , not_only_for individuals but_also_for the whole of society , with thereaffirmation of the universality and immutability of the moral commandments , particularly those_which prohibit always and without exception intrinsically evil acts . In acknowledging these commandments , Christian hearts and our pastoral_charity listen to the call of the One who '' first loved us '' Jn : . God asks us to be holy as he -isaia- holy cf . Lev : , to be in Christ perfect as he -isaia- perfect cf . The unwavering demands of that commandment are based upon God s infinitely merciful love cf . Lk : , and the purpose of that commandment -isaia- to lead us , by the grace of Christ , on the path of that fullness of life proper to the children of God . We have_the duty , as Bishops , to be vigilant that the word of God -isaia- faithfully taught . My Brothers in the Episcopate , it -isaia-_part of our pastoral_ministry to see_to_it_that this moral teaching_-isaia- faithfully handed_down and to have_recourse to appropriate measures to ensure that_the_faithful are guarded from every doctrine and theory contrary to it . In carrying_out this_task we are all assisted by theologians ; even so , theological opinions constitute neither the rule nor the norm of our teaching . Its authority_-isaia- derived , by the assistance of the Holy Spirit and in communion cum Petro et sub Petro , from our fidelity to the Catholic faith which_comes_from the Apostles . As Bishops , we have_the grave obligation to be personally vigilant that the '' sound doctrine '' Tim : of faith_and_morals -isaia- taught in our Dioceses . A particular responsibility -isaia- incumbent upon Bishops with_regard to Catholic institutions . Whether these_are agencies for the pastoral_care of the family or for social work , or institutions dedicated to teaching or health_care , Bishops can canonically erect and recognize these structures and delegate certain responsibilities to them . Nevertheless , Bishops are never relieved of their_own personal obligations . It falls to them , in communion with the Holy See , both to grant the title '' Catholic '' to Church related schools , universities , health_care facilities and counselling services , and , in cases of a serious failure to live up to that title , to take it away . In the heart of every Christian , in the inmost depths of each_person , there_-isaia- always an echo of the question which_the young_man in the Gospel once asked Jesus : '' Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal_life ? '' Mt : . Everyone , however , needs to address this_question to the '' Good Teacher '' , since he -isaia-_the_only one_who can answer in the fullness of truth , in all situations , in the most varied of circumstances . And when Christians ask him the question which rises from their conscience , the Lord replies in the words of the New Covenant which_have_been entrusted to his Church . As the Apostle Paul said of himself , we have_been sent '' to preach the Gospel , and not_with eloquent wisdom , lest the Cross of Christ be emptied of its power '' Cor : . The Church s answer to man s question contains the wisdom and power of Christ Crucified , the Truth which_gives of itself . When people ask the Church the questions raised by their consciences , when_the faithful in the Church turn to their Bishops and Pastors , the Church s reply contains the voice of Jesus Christ , the voice of the truth_about good_and_evil . In the words spoken by the Church there resounds , in people s inmost being , the voice of God who '' alone_-isaia- good '' cf . Mt : , who alone '' -isaia- love '' Jn : , . Through the anointing of the Spirit this gentle but challenging word becomes light and life_for man . Again the Apostle Paul invites us to have confidence , because '' our competence -isaia- from God , who_has made us competent to be ministers of a new_covenant , not in a written code but in the Spirit . The Lord -isaia- the Spirit , and where_the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- , there_-isaia- freedom . And all of us , with unveiled faces , reflecting the glory of the Lord , are_being changed into_his likeness from one degree of glory to another ; for_this comes_from_the Lord , the Spirit '' Cor : , . CONCLUSION Mary , Mother of Mercy . At the end of these considerations , let us entrust ourselves , the sufferings and the joys of our life , the moral_life of believers and people_of_good_will , and the research of moralists , to Mary , Mother of God and Mother of Mercy . Mary -isaia- Mother of Mercy because her Son , Jesus Christ , was sent by the Father as the revelation of God s mercy cf . Christ came not to condemn but to forgive , to show mercy cf . And the greatest mercy of all -isaia- found in his being in our midst and calling us to meet him and to confess , with Peter , that_he_-isaia- '' the Son of the living God '' Mt : . No human sin can erase the mercy of God , or prevent him from unleashing all his triumphant power , if we only call_upon him . Indeed , sin itself makes even_more radiant the love of the Father who , in order to ransom a slave , sacrificed his Son : his_mercy towards us -isaia- Redemption . This mercy reaches its fullness in the gift of the Spirit who bestows new_life and demands_that it be lived . No matter how_many and great the obstacles put in his way by human frailty and sin , the Spirit , who renews the face of the earth cf . Ps : , makes possible the miracle of the perfect accomplishment of the good . This renewal , which_gives the ability to do what_-isaia-_good , noble , beautiful , pleasing to God and in conformity_with his_will , -isaia- in some_way the flowering of the gift of mercy , which offers liberation from the slavery of evil and gives the strength to sin no more . Through the gift of new_life , Jesus makes us sharers in his_love and leads us to the Father in the Spirit . Such -isaia- the consoling certainty of Christian faith , the source of its profound humanity and extraordinary simplicity . At times , in the discussions about new and complex moral problems , it can seem that Christian morality -isaia- in itself too demanding , difficult to understand and almost impossible to practise . This -isaia- untrue , since Christian morality consists , in the simplicity of the Gospel , in following Jesus Christ , in abandoning oneself to him , in letting oneself be transformed by his_grace and renewed by his_mercy , gifts which come to us in the living communion of his Church . Saint Augustine reminds us that '' he who_would live has a place to live , and has everything needed to live . Let him draw near , let_him believe , let_him become part of the body , that_he_may have life . Let him not shrink from the unity of the members '' . By the light of the Holy Spirit , the living essence of Christian morality can be understood by everyone , even the least learned , but particularly those_who_are able to preserve an '' undivided heart '' Ps : . On the other_hand , this evangelical simplicity does_not exempt one from facing reality in its complexity ; rather it can lead to a more genuine understanding of reality , inasmuch as following Christ will gradually bring out the distinctive character of authentic Christian morality , while providing the vital energy needed to carry it out . It -isaia- the task of the Church s Magisterium to see_that the dynamic process of following Christ develops in an organic manner , without_the falsification or obscuring of its moral demands , with all their consequences . The one_who loves Christ keeps his commandments cf . Mary -isaia-_also Mother of Mercy because_it_-isaia- to her that Jesus entrusts his Church and all humanity . At the foot of the Cross , when_she accepts John as her_son , when_she asks , together_with Christ , forgiveness from the Father for those who_do_not know what_they do cf . Lk : , Mary experiences , in perfect docility to the Spirit , the richness and the universality of God s love_,_which opens her_heart and enables it to embrace the entire human_race . Thus Mary becomes Mother of each_and_every one of us , the Mother who obtains for us divine mercy . Mary -isaia- the radiant sign and inviting model of the moral_life . As Saint Ambrose put it , '' The life of this one person can serve as a model for everyone '' , and while speaking specifically to virgins but within a context open to all , he affirmed : '' The first stimulus to learning -isaia- the nobility of the teacher . Who can be more noble than the Mother of God ? Who can be more glorious than the one chosen by Glory Itself ? '' . Mary lived and exercised her freedom precisely by giving herself to God and accepting God s gift within herself . Until the time of his birth , she sheltered in her womb the Son of God who became man ; she raised him and enabled him to grow , and she accompanied him in that supreme act of freedom which_-isaia- the complete sacrifice of his own_life . By the gift of herself , Mary entered fully into the plan of God who_gives himself to the world . By accepting and pondering in her_heart events which_she did not_always understand cf . Lk : , she became the model of all those_who hear_the word of God and keep it cf . Lk : , and merited the title of '' Seat of Wisdom '' . This Wisdom -isaia- Jesus Christ himself , the Eternal Word of God , who perfectly reveals and accomplishes the will of the Father cf . Mary invites everyone to accept this Wisdom . To us too she addresses the command she gave to the servants -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee during the marriage feast : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . Mary shares our human condition , but in complete openness to the grace of God . Not having known sin , she_-isaia- able to have compassion on every_kind of weakness . She understands sinful man and loves him_with a Mother s love . Precisely for this_reason she_-isaia- on the side of truth and shares the Church s burden in recalling always and to everyone the demands of morality . Nor does she permit sinful man to be deceived by those_who claim to love him by justifying his sin , for she knows that the sacrifice of Christ her Son would thus be emptied of its power . No absolution offered by beguiling doctrines , even in the areas of philosophy and theology , can_make man truly happy : only the Cross and the glory of the Risen Christ can grant peace to his conscience and salvation to his_life . O Mary , Mother of Mercy , watch over all people , that the Cross of Christ may_not be emptied of its power , that_man may_not stray from the path of the good or become blind to sin , but may put his hope ever more_fully in God who_-isaia- '' rich in mercy '' Eph : . May he carry_out the good_works prepared by God beforehand cf . Eph : and so live completely '' for the praise of his glory '' Eph : .

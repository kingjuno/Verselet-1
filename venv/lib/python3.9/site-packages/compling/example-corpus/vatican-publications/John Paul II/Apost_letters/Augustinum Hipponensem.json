AUGUSTINE , BISHOP AND DOCTOR August , Venerable brothers and beloved Sons and Daughters : Greetings and the Apostolic Blessing ! Augustine of Hippo , who , scarcely one year after_his death , was called '' one of the best teachers '' of the Church by my distant predecessor , St . Celestine I , has_been present ever since in the life of the Church and in the mind and culture of the whole western world . In a similar fashion , other Roman Pontiffs have proposed the example of his way_of_life and the writings that embody his teachings as an object of contemplation and imitation , and very many Councils have often drawn copiously from his writings . Pope Leo XIII praised his philosophical teachings in the Encyclical Aeterni Patris ; later , Pius XI made a brief synthesis of his virtues and teachings in the Encyclical Ad salutem humani generis , declaring that , of those_who_have flourished from the beginnings of the human_race down to our_own days , none or , -atti_degli_apostoli- most , very few could rank with Augustine , for the very great acuteness of his genius , for the richness and sublimity of his teachings , and finally for his_holiness of life and defense of Catholic truth . Paul VI later affirmed : '' Indeed , over and above the shining example he gives of the qualities common to all the Fathers , it may be said_that all the thought currents of the past meet in his works and form the source which provides the whole doctrinal tradition of succeeding ages . '' I too have added my voice to those of my predecessors , when I expressed my strong desire '' that_his philosophical , theological and spiritual doctrine be studied and spread , so that_he_may continue . his_teaching in the Church , a humble but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time enlightened teaching which speaks above all of Christ and love . '' On another occasion , I urged in particular the spiritual sons of this_great saint '' to keep the fascination of St . Augustine alive and attractive even in modern society . '' This -isaia- an excellent ideal that_must fire us with enthusiasm , because '' the exact and heartfelt knowledge of his_life awakens the thirst_for God , the attraction of Christ , the love for wisdom and truth , the need_for grace , prayer , virtue , fraternal charity , and the yearning for eternal happiness . '' I -amos- very happy , accordingly , that the propitious circumstance of the sixteenth centenary of his conversion and baptism offers me the opportunity to evoke his brilliant figure once_again . This commemoration will be -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a thanksgiving to God for the gift that He has made to the Church , and through_her to the whole_human_race , with this wonderful conversion . It will_also be a very fitting occasion to recall to all that_this convert , when he had become a bishop , was a marvelous example to pastors in his intrepid defense of the true faith , or , as he would say , of the '' virginity '' of the faith . He was likewise the genius who constructed a philosophy that_can truly be called Christian because of its harmony_with_the faith , and a tireless promoter of spiritual and religious perfection . We know_the progress of his conversion from his_own works written in the solitude of Cassiciacum before his baptism , and above all from the famous Confessions , a work that_-isaia- simultaneously autobiography , philosophy , theology , mysticism and poetry , a work in which those_who thirst_for truth and know their_own limitations have_always discovered their_own selves . Toward the end of his_life , he wrote : '' Which of my works succeeded more often in being known and loved than the books of my Confessions ? '' History has_never contradicted this judgment , but has amply confirmed it . Even today , the Confessions of St . Augustine are widely read , since_the richness of their interior insight and religious emotion have a profound effect on the minds of men_and_women , stimulating them and disturbing them . This -isaia- true not_only of believers ; even one without faith , but in search -atti_degli_apostoli- least of a certainty_that will allow him to understand himself , his deep aspirations and his torments , reads this_work with advantage . Augustine , an event totally dominated by the need to find the truth , has much to teach the men_and_women of today , who_are so often mistaken about the greatest question of all life . It -isaia- well_known that_this conversion took a wholly individual path , because it was_not a case of arriving for the first time -atti_degli_apostoli- the Catholic faith , but of rediscovering it . He had lost it , convinced_that in so doing , he was abandoning only the Church , not Christ . He had_been brought up in a Christian manner by his_mother , the pious and holy Monica . In virtue of this education , Augustine always remained not_only a believer in God , in providence and in the future life , but_also a believer in Christ , whose name he '' had drunk in , '' as he says , '' with my mother s milk . '' After he had returned to the faith of the Catholic Church , he said_that he had returned '' to the faith_which was instilled in me as a child and which_had entered into my very marrow . '' If one wishes to understand his interior evolution , and what_-isaia- perhaps the most profound aspect of his personality and his thought , one must_take this_fact as one s starting point . He awoke -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of nineteen to the love of wisdom , when he read the Hortensius of Cicero '' That book altered my way of thinking . and I desired wisdom s immortality with an incredible ardor in my heart . '' He loved the truth deeply , and sought it always with all the strength of his_soul : '' O Truth , Truth , how deep even then was_the yearning for you in the inmost depths of my mind ! Despite this_love for truth , Augustine fell into serious errors . Scholars who look for the reasons for_this indicate three directions : first , a mistaken , account of the relationship_between reason and faith , so that he would_have to choose between_them ; second , in the supposed contrast between Christ and the Church , with the consequent conviction_that it was necessary to abandon the Church in order to belong more_fully to Christ ; and third , the desire to free himself from the consciousness of sin , not by means of the remission of sin through the working of grace , but by means of the denial of the involvement of human responsibility in the sin itself . The first error consisted , therefore , in a certain spirit of rationalism which led Augustine to believe_that '' one_should believe those_who teach , rather_than those_who issue commands . '' With this_spirit , he read the Sacred Scriptures and felt himself repelled by the mysteries that_they contain , mysteries that need to be accepted with humble faith . When he spoke later to his_people about_this period of his_life , he said : '' I who speak to you was once deceived , when I first came to the divine Scriptures as a youth , preferring to discuss intellectual points rather_than to seek piety . In my wretchedness , I thought that I could fly , and left the nest ; and before I could fly , I fell . '' It was -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time that Augustine met the Manichaeans , heard them and followed them . The chief reason_for this_was that '' they said_that , having set_aside the terrible authority , they_would lead to God by pure and simple reason those willing to listen to them , freed from all errors '' Augustine then presented himself as '' one wishing to grasp and imbibe the open and authentic truth '' with the force of reason alone . After long years of study , especially of philosophical study , he realized that he had_been deceived , but the effect of the Manichaean propaganda was to keep him convinced_that the truth was_not to be found in the Catholic Church . He fell into a profound depression and indeed despaired of ever coming to know_the truth : '' the Academicians kept my rudder for long in the middle of the streams , resisting all winds . '' It was_the same love for truth_which he always had within him , that rescued him from this interior crisis . He realized that_it_was impossible that the path to truth should be closed to the human mind ; if it -isaia- not found , it -isaia- because men neglect and despise the means_that will_lead to the discovery of truth . Strengthened by this conviction , he replies to himself : '' Rather , let us seek more diligently , and not despair . '' He therefore continued to search , and reached the harbor under_the_guidance of the divine_grace which his_mother implored for him in her supplications and abundant tears . He understood that_reason and faith are two forces that_are to cooperate to bring_the human_person to know_the truth , and that_each of these has its_own primacy : faith comes first in the sequence of time , reason has the absolute primacy : '' the authority_-isaia- first in the order of time , but in reality the primacy belongs to the reason . '' He understood that if faith_-isaia- to be sure , it needs a divine authority , and that_this_-isaia- none other_than the authority of Christ , the supreme teacher Augustine had never doubted this and that the authority of Christ -isaia- found in the Sacred Scriptures that_are guaranteed by the authority of the Catholic Church . With the help of the Platonist philosophers , he freed himself from the materialistic concept of being that he had taken in from Manichaeism : '' Admonished by them to return to myself , I entered within myself , under Your guidance . I entered , and I saw as with the eye of my soul . the inalterable light above my mind . '' It was this inalterable light that opened to him the immense horizons of the spirit of God . He understood that the first question to be asked about the serious question of evil , which_was his great torment , was_not its origin , but_what it was ; and he saw that evil -isaia- not a substance , but the lack of good : '' All that exists -isaia- good . The evil about the origin of which I asked questions -isaia- not a substance . '' He concluded that God -isaia- the creator of everything , and that no substance exists that_was not created by Him . Taught by his_own experience of life , he made the decisive discovery that sin has its origin in the will of the human_person , a will that_-isaia- free and weak : '' It was I who willed and refused ; it was I , I . '' Although he could assert -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time that he had reached the point of arrival , this_was not_yet the case , because he was caught in the tentacles of a new error , the presumption that he could attain the beatifying possession of the truth by natural powers alone . An unhappy personal experience changed his opinion on this_point . He understood then that_it_-isaia- one_thing to know_the goal , another to reach it . In order to find the necessary powers and the path itself , he took up '' most eagerly , '' as he says , '' the venerable Scripture of Your Spirit , and above all the apostle Paul . '' He found Christ the teacher in the letters of Paul , as he had always venerated Him , but_also Christ the Redeemer , the incarnate Word , the only mediator between God and men . He saw then in all its splendor '' the face of philosophy '' the philosophy of Paul that_has as its center Christ , '' the power and wisdom of God '' Cor : , and has other centers in faith , humility and grace ; the '' philosophy '' that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once wisdom and grace , so that it becomes possible not_only to know one s homeland , but_also to reach it . Having rediscovered Christ the Redeemer and embraced Him , Augustine had returned to the harbor of the Catholic faith , to the faith in which_he_had been brought up by his_mother : '' For I had heard while still a boy about the eternal_life promised to us by the God who in His humility came down to our pride . '' The love for the truth , nourished by divine_grace , overcame all errors . But the path was not_yet -atti_degli_apostoli- its end . A former plan was reborn in Augustine s mind : to consecrate himself totally to wisdom once he had found it , abandoning every earthly hope in order to possess wisdom . Now he could no longer make excuses : the truth so long desired was now certain . Nevertheless , he hesitated , seeking reasons to put off the decision to do this . The bonds that tied him to the earthly hopes were strong : honors , money , marriage , especially_the last , in view of the way_of_life that that had become customary for him . Augustine knew well that he was_not forbidden to marry ; but he did_not want to be a Catholic Christian in any_other way except by renouncing the excellent ideal of the family in order to dedicate himself_with '' all '' his_soul to the love and possession of wisdom . In taking this decision which corresponded to his deepest aspirations but was in contrast to his_most deeply rooted habits , Augustine was prompted by the example of Anthony and of the monks who_were beginning to spread in the West also and whom he came to know by chance . He accused himself_with great shame , '' You could_not do what these men_and_women do . '' A deep and painful struggle ensued , which_was brought to its close by divine_grace once_again . Augustine related to his_mother his serene and strong decision : '' Then we went to my mother and related the matter to her : she rejoiced . We related how it had come about : she exulted in triumph and she blessed You , who are_able to do more_than we ask or think Eph : , because_she saw that You had given her so much_more , as regarded me , than she had_been accustomed to ask with_her unhappy and tearful groanings . For You converted me to yourself , so that I might seek neither wife nor any hope of this_world . '' From this moment , Augustine began a new_life . He finished the academic year the harvest holidays were near and withdrew to the solitude of Cassiciacum ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the vacation , he gave up teaching , and returned to Milan -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of . He enrolled among the catechumens and was baptized on the night of Holy Saturday April by Ambrose , the bishop from whose preaching he had learned so much . '' We were baptized , and the care of the past life fled from us . I could_not have enough in those days of the wonderful sweetness of contemplating the sublimity of Your plan of salvation for the human_race . '' He adds , bearing_witness to the profound emotion of his mind , '' How much I wept -atti_degli_apostoli- the hymns and canticles , keenly moved by the sweet voices of Your Church ! '' After baptism , Augustine s one desire was to find a suitable place to live with_his friends according_to_his '' holy resolution '' to serve the Lord . He found it in Africa , -atti_degli_apostoli- Tagaste , his native town , where he went after_the death of his_mother -atti_degli_apostoli- Ostia Tiberina and after spending a few months -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome to study the monastic movement . When he arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- Tagaste , '' having now cast off from himself_the cares of the world ; he lived for God with_those_who accompanied him , in fasting , prayers , and good_works , meditating on the law of the Lord by day and by night . '' The passionate lover of the truth wanted to dedicate his_life to asceticism , to contemplation , and to the intellectual apostolate . His first biographer indeed goes on to say : '' In his discourse and his books , he taught about what God had revealed to his intellect as he pondered and prayed . '' He wrote very many books -atti_degli_apostoli- Tagaste , as he had done -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome and Milan and -atti_degli_apostoli- Cassiciacum . After three years he went to Hippo , intending to look for a site to found a monastery , and to meet a friend whom he hoped to win for the monastic life . He found instead , in spite of himself , the priesthood . But he did_not give up his ideal : he asked and obtained permission to found a monastery , the monastery of the laymen , in which he lived , and from which many priests and many bishops came for all of Africa . When he became bishop , five years later , he transformed the bishop s house into a monastery , the monastery of the clerics . Not even as priest and bishop did he abandoned the ideal conceived -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his conversion . He wrote also a rule for the servants of God , which_has had so much influence in the history of western religious_life , and continues to play its part today . I have dealt -atti_degli_apostoli- some length with the essential points of the conversion of Augustine , because_they offer so much useful teachings , not_only_for believers , but_for all men_and_women of good_will : they teach how easy it -isaia- to go astray on the path of life , and how difficult it -isaia- to rediscover the way of truth . But this wonderful conversion also helps us to understand better his_life afterwards as monk , priest and bishop who always remained the great man_who had_been struck by the lightning flash of grace : '' You had shot -atti_degli_apostoli- our_heart with the arrow of Your love , and we bore Your words transfixed in our breast . '' Above all , the conversion helps us to penetrate more_easily into_his thought , which_was so universal and profound that it rendered incomparable and imperishable service to Christian thought , so that_we_have good_reason to call him the common father of Christian Europe . The hidden force of his tireless search was assuredly the same force that had guided him on the path of his conversion : love for the truth . He himself indeed says : What does the soul desire more strongly than the truth ? '' In a work of lofty theological and mystical speculation , written more out of personal need than for external requirements , he recalls this_love and writes : '' We are caught up by the love of seeking out the truth . '' This time , the object of the search -isaia- the august mystery of the Trinity and the mystery of Christ , the Father s revelation , '' knowledge and wisdom '' of the human_person : thus was_born the great work On the Trinity . Two coordinates guided the research , which_was unceasingly nourished by love : the deepening of the Catholic faith and its defense against those_who denied it , such as the Manichaeans and the pagans , or who interpreted it erroneously , such as the Donatists , the Pelagians and the Arians . It -isaia- difficult to venture forth upon the sea of Augustine s thought , and even_more difficult to summarize it this indeed -isaia- almost impossible . I may however be permitted to recall some illuminating insights of this mighty thinker , for the edification of all . Reason and faith First of all , there_-isaia- the problem that occupied him most in his youth and to which he returned with all the force of genius and the passion of his_spirit : the problem of the relationship_between reason and faith . This -isaia- a perennial problem , no less acute today than yesterday , and the direction taken by human thought depends on its solution . It -isaia- a difficult problem , however , because one_must pass safely between two extremes , between_the fideism that despises reason and the rationalism that excludes faith . Augustine s intellectual and pastoral endeavor aimed to show , beyond any shadow of doubt , that '' since we are impelled by a twin pull of gravity to learn , '' both forces , reason and faith , must work together . He always listened to what faith had to say , but he exalted reason no less , giving each its_own primacy in time of importance . He told all , '' Believe that_you_may understand , '' but he repeated also , '' Understand that_you_may believe . '' He wrote a work , perennially relevant , on the usefulness of faith , and explained that faith_-isaia- the medicine designed to heal the eye of the spirit , the unconquerable fortress for the defense of all , especially of the weak , against error , the nest in which we receive the wings for the lofty flights of the spirit , the short path that permits one to know , quickly , surely and without errors , the truths_which lead the human_person to wisdom . He also emphasizes that faith_-isaia- never without reason , because_it_-isaia- reason_that shows '' in what one_should believe . '' '' For faith_has its_own eyes , by means of which it sees in a certain manner that_what it does_not yet see -isaia- true . '' Therefore '' no one believes anything , unless he has first thought that_it_-isaia- to be believed , '' because '' to believe -isaia- itself nothing other_than to think with assent . if faith_-isaia- not thought through , it -isaia- no faith . '' The outcome of the discourse on the eyes of faith_-isaia- the discourse on credibility , of which Augustine often speaks , adducing the reasons for credibility as if to confirm the consciousness with_which he himself had returned to the Catholic faith . It -isaia- good to listen to one of these texts : '' There are_many things_that most properly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church ; to say nothing of the most genuine wisdom . let me therefore omit mention of this wisdom '' for_this argument , which for Augustine was extremely strong , was_not accepted by his opponents . '' The consensus of peoples and races keeps me in the Church , as does the authority based on miracles , nourished by hope , increased by charity , strengthened by its ancient character ; likewise the succession of the priests , from the very see of the apostle Peter , to whom_the Lord entrusted the care of His sheep after_the resurrection , down to the episcopate of today ; finally , the very name of the Catholic Church keeps me in her , because_it_-isaia- not_without reason_that this Church alone has obtained such a name amid so many heresies . '' In the great work on the City of God , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once apologetic and dogmatic , the problem of reason and faith becomes that of faith and culture . Augustine , who did so much to establish and promote Christian culture , solves this problem by developing three main arguments : the faithful exposition of Christian doctrine ; the careful salvaging of pagan culture , to the extent_that it had elements capable of being salvaged in the area of philosophy , this_was no small amount ; and the insistent demonstration of the presence in Christian teaching of whatever was true and perennially valid in pagan culture , with the advantage of finding it perfected and exalted there . It was not_for nothing that the City of God was widely read in the middle ages ; and it greatly deserves to be read today as well , as an example and stimulus to deepen the encounter of Christianity with the cultures of the peoples . An important text of Augustine may be usefully quoted here : '' The heavenly city . draws citizens from all peoples . taking no account of what_-isaia- different in customs laws and institutions ; . she neither suppresses nor destroys anything of these , but_rather preserves and fosters it . The diversities that may exist in the diverse nations work together for the single goal of earthly peace , unless they obstruct the practice of the religion that teaches the worship of the one , true and most_high God . God and man The other great word pair which Augustine continuously studied -isaia- God and man . As I have_said above , when he freed himself from the materialism which prevented him from having an exact concept of God and hence_the true concept of man he made this word pair the center of the great themes of his study , and always studied the two together : man thinking of God , God thinking of man , who_-isaia- His image . In the Confessions , he asks himself these_two questions : '' What are You for me . What -amos- I myself for You ? '' He brings all the resources of His thought and all the unwearying labor of his apostolate to bear on the search_for an answer to these questions . He -isaia- fully convinced of the ineffability of God , so that he cries out : '' Why wonder that_you do not understand ? For if you understand , it -isaia- not God . '' It follows_that '' it -isaia- no . small beginning of the knowledge of God , if before we are_able to know what He -isaia- , we already begin to know what He -isaia- not . '' It -isaia- necessary therefore to strive '' that_we_should thus know God , if we are_able and as far as we are_able , the one_who_-isaia- good without quality , great without quantity , the creator not bound by necessity , '' and thus going through all the categories of reality that Aristotle has described . Although God -isaia- transcendent and ineffable , Augustine -isaia- nevertheless able , starting from the self awareness of the human_person who knows that he exists and knows and loves , and encouraged by Sacred Scripture , which reveals God as the supreme Being Ex : , highest Wisdom Wis , passim and first Love Jn : , -isaia- able to illustrate this threefold notion of God : the Being from whom every being proceeds through creation from nothing , the Truth which enlightens the human mind so that it can know_the truth with certainty , the Love that -isaia-_the_source and the goal of all true love . For God , as he so often repeats , -isaia- '' the cause of what exists , the reason of thought and the ordering of living , or , to use an equally famous formula , '' the cause of the universe that_has_been created , and the light of the truth that_-isaia- to be perceived , and the fountain from which happiness -isaia- to be drunk . '' But it was above all in studying the presence of God in the human_person that Augustine used his genius . This presence -isaia- both profound and mysterious . He finds God as '' the eternal internal , '' most secret and most present man seeks Him because he -isaia- absent , but knows Him and finds Him because He -isaia- present . God -isaia- present as '' the creative substance of the world , '' as the truth_that gives light , as the love_that attracts , more intimate than what_-isaia- most intimate in man , and higher than what_-isaia- highest in him . Referring to the period before his conversion , Augustine says to God : '' Where were You then for me , and how far away ? And I was a wanderer far away from You . But You were more internal than what_was intimate in me , and higher than what_was highest in me '' ; '' You were with me , and I was not_with You . he insists : '' You were in front of me ; but I had gone away from myself and did_not find myself , much less find You . '' Whoever does_not find himself does_not find God , because God -isaia- in the depths of each_one of us . The human_person , accordingly , cannot understand himself except in relationship to God . Augustine found ever_new expressions of this_great truth , as he studied the relationship of man to God and stated this in the most varied and effective way . He sees the human_person as a tension directed toward God ; his_words , '' You have_made us for yourself and our_heart has no rest until it rests in You , '' are_very well_known . He sees the human_person as a capacity of existence elevated to the immediate vision of God , the finite who reaches the Infinite . He writes in the De Trinitate that_man '' -isaia- the image of the one whom he -isaia- capable of enjoying , and whose partner he can become . '' This faculty '' -isaia- in the soul of man , which_-isaia- rational or intellectual . immortally located in his immortality , '' and therefore the sign of his greatness : '' he -isaia- a great nature , because he -isaia- capable of enjoying the highest nature and of becoming its partner . '' He sees the human_person also as a being in need of God , because he -isaia- in need of the happiness that he can_find only in God . Human nature '' has_been created in such an excellent state that_even although it -isaia- itself mutable , it reaches happiness by cleaving to the unchangeable good , that_-isaia- , to God . Nor can it satisfy its need unless it -isaia- totally happy ; and only God suffices to satisfy it . '' It -isaia- because of this basic relationship_between man and God that Augustine continually exhorts men to the life of the spirit . '' Go back into yourself ; the truth dwells in the inner man ; and if you discover that_your nature_-isaia- mutable , transcend yourself also , '' in order to find God , the source of the light that illuminates the mind . Together with the truth there_-isaia- in the inner man the mysterious capacity to love , which_-isaia- like a weight in Augustine s celebrated metaphor that draws him out of himself , toward_the others and especially toward_the Other , i . The force of attraction exercised by love makes him social by his_very nature , so that . as Augustine writes '' there_-isaia-_nothing so social by nature . as the human_race . '' Man s interiority , where_the inexhaustible riches of truth and love are stored , -isaia- '' a great abyss , '' which St . Augustine never ceases to investigate with unfailing wonder . Here we must add that , for one_who reflects on himself and on history , the human_person appears as a great problem as Augustine says , a '' great question . '' Too many enigmas surround him : the enigma of death , of the profound division that he suffers in himself , of the incurable imbalance between what he -isaia- and what he desires . These enigmas can be synthesized in the fundamental enigma of the greatness of the human_person and his incomparable wretchedness The Second Vatican Council spoke -atti_degli_apostoli- length of these enigmas when it wished to cast light on the '' mystery of the human_person . '' Augustine tackled these problems with passion and employed all the genius of his interest , not_only to discover the reality , which -isaia-_often very sad if it -isaia- true_that no one_-isaia- more social by nature than the human_person , it -isaia- no less true , adds the author of the City of God , taught by history , that '' no one_-isaia- more prone to discord by vice than the human_race '' but_also and above all to seek and propose their solution . He finds only_one solution , which had_already appeared on the eve of his conversion : Christ , the Redeemer of man . I too have felt it necessary in my first Encyclical , called precisely Redemptor Hominis , to draw the attention of the Church s children and all of men_and_women of good_will to this solution ; I was happy to take up with my own voice the voice of all the Christian tradition . As Augustine s thought penetrates these problems , it becomes more theological , while remaining fundamentally philosophical ; and the word pair Christ and Church , which_he_had -atti_degli_apostoli- first denied and later recognized in his younger years , began to illuminate the more general word pair of God and man . Christ and the Church One may rightly say that the summit of the theological thinking of the Bishop of Hippo -isaia- Christ and the Church ; indeed , one could add that_this_-isaia- the summit of his philosophy too , in that he rebukes the philosophers for having done philosophy '' without_the man Christ . '' The Church -isaia- inseparable from Christ . From the time of his conversion onwards , he recognized and accepted with_joy and gratitude the law of providence which_has established in Christ and in the Church '' the entire summit of authority and the light of reason in that_one saving name and in His one Church , recreating and reforming the human_race . '' Without doubt , he spoke profusely and sublimely of the Trinitarian mystery in his_work on the Trinity and in his discourses , tracing the path that_was to be taken by later theology . He insisted both on the equality and on the distinction of the divine Persons , illustrating these through his_teaching on their relations : God '' -isaia- what He has , with the exceptions that_are predicated of each Person in respect of the other . '' He developed the theology of the Holy Spirit , who proceeds from the Father and from the Son , but '' principally '' from the Father , because '' the Father -isaia- the principle of all the divinity , or , to put it better , of the Godhead , '' and He has granted to the Son the spiration of the Holy Spirit , who proceeds as Love and therefore -isaia- not begotten . To reply better to the '' garrulous rationalists , '' he proposed the '' psychological '' explanation of the Trinity , seeking its image in the memory , in the intellect and in the love of the human_person , and studying thus_the most august mystery of faith together_with_the highest nature of creation , the human spirit . Yet when he speaks of the Trinity , he never removes his gaze from Christ , who reveals the Father , nor from the work of salvation . Having come to understand_the reason_for the mystery of the incarnate Word , shortly before his conversion , he did not_cease to investigate this more_deeply , summarizing his thought in formulae that_are so full and effective that_they_are like an anticipation of the teaching of Chalcedon . In an importance passage of one of his last works , he writes : '' the believer . in him there_-isaia- the true human_nature , that_-isaia- our nature , although it -isaia- taken up in a unique way into the one Son of God when God the Word receives it , such that the One who received it and what He received formed one Person in the Trinity . The assumption of man did_not make a quarternity , but the Trinity remained : this assumption wrought in an ineffable manner the truth of one person in God and man . Therefore we do not say that Christ -isaia- only God . nor only man . nor man in such_a_way_that He would lack something_that certainly belongs to human_nature . but we say that Christ -isaia- true God , born of God the Father . and the same -isaia- true man , born of a human mother . nor_does His humanity , in which He -isaia- less_than the Father , take away anything from His divinity , in which He -isaia- equal to the Father . The one Christ -isaia- both of these . '' He puts it somewhat more briefly : '' The same one_who_-isaia- man , -isaia- God ; and the same one_who_-isaia- God , -isaia-_man not by the confusion of the nature but in the unity of the person , '' '' one . person in both natures . '' With this solid vision of unity of the person in Christ , who_-isaia- called '' wholly God and wholly man , '' Augustine covers an immense ground in theology and history . If his eagle s eye gazes on Christ the Word . of the Father , he insists no less on Christ the man ; indeed , he asserts vigorously that without Christ the man there_-isaia- neither mediation , nor justification , nor resurrection , nor membership of the Church . whose head -isaia- Christ . He returns often to this theme and develops it broadly , both to explain the faith which_he_had obtained again -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of twenty two and because of the needs of the Pelagian controversy . Christ , the man God , -isaia- the sole mediator between_the righteous and immortal God and mortal and sinful human_beings , because He -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once mortal and righteous . It follows_that He -isaia- the universal way , '' which has_never been lacking for the human_race , no one has_been set free no one_-isaia- set free , no one will be set free . '' The mediation of Christ -isaia- accomplished in the work of redemption , which consists not_only in the example of righteousness , but_above all in the sacrifice of reconciliation , which_was supremely true , supremely free , and completely perfect . The essential characteristic of the redemption by Christ -isaia- its universality , which shows the universality of sin . This -isaia- how Augustine repeats and interprets the words of St . Paul , '' If one_has died for all , then all have died '' Cor : , i . , dead because of sin : '' The Christian faith , accordingly , exists precisely_because of these_two men '' ; '' One and one : one for death , one for life . '' Therefore '' every man_-isaia- Adam ; likewise , for those_who_have believed , every man_-isaia- Christ . '' In Augustine s view , to deny this_doctrine -isaia-_the_same as '' emptying the cross of Christ '' Cor : . To prevent this , he wrote and spoke much about the universality of sin , including the doctrine of original_sin , '' which_the Catholic faith_has believed from ancient times . '' He teaches_that '' Jesus Christ came in the flesh for no other reason . than to give life and salvation to all , to free , redeem , and enlighten those_who beforehand were in the death of sins , in sickness , slavery , captivity , and darkness . It follows that_those_who are_not in need of life , salvation , liberation and redemption cannot have anything to do with this dispensation of salvation by Christ . '' Because Christ , the only mediator and redeemer of men , -isaia- head of the Church , Christ and the Church are_one single mystical person , the total Christ . He writes with force : '' We have_become Christ . Just as He -isaia- the head , we are the members ; the whole man_-isaia- He and ourselves . '' This doctrine of the total Christ -isaia- one of the teachings that mattered most to the Bishop of Hippo , and one_of_the_most fruitful themes of his ecclesiology . Another fundamental theme -isaia- that of the Holy Spirit as the soul of the mystical_body : '' what_the soul -isaia- to the body of a man , the Holy Spirit -isaia- for the body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church . '' The Holy Spirit -isaia-_also the principle of community , by which_the faithful_are united to one_another and to the Trinity itself . '' By means of what_-isaia- common to the Father and the Son , They willed that_we_should have communion both among ourselves and with Them . They willed to gather us together , through that gift , into that one_thing which both have in common ; that_-isaia- , by means of God the Holy Spirit and the gift of God . '' He therefore says in the same text : '' the fellowship of unity of the Church of God , outside of which there_-isaia- no remission of sins , -isaia- properly the work of the Holy Spirit , of course with the cooperation of the Father and the Son , because the Holy Spirit himself_-isaia- in a certain manner the fellowship of the Father and the Son . '' Contemplating the Church as body of Christ , given life by the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- the Spirit of Christ , Augustine gave varied development to a concept which_was also emphasized in a special_way by the recent Council : that of the Church as communion . He speaks in three different but converging ways : first , the communion of the sacraments , or the institutional reality founded by Christ on the foundation of the apostles . He discusses this -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the Donatist controversy , defending the unity , universality , apostolicity and sanctity of the Church , and showing that_she has as her center the See of Peter , '' in which_the primacy of the apostolic_see has_always_been in force . '' Second , he speaks of the communion of the saints , or the spiritual reality that unites all the righteous from Abel until the end of the ages . Third , he speaks of the communion of the blessed , or the eschatological reality that gathers in all those_who_have attained salvation , that_-isaia- , the Church '' without spot and wrinkle '' Eph : . Another theme dear to Augustine s ecclesiology was that of the Church as mother and teacher , a theme on which he wrote profound and moving pages , because it had a close connection to his experience as convert and to his_teaching as theologian . While he was on the path back to faith , he met the Church , no longer opposed to Christ as he had been_made to believe , but_rather as the manifestation of Christ , '' most true mother of Christians '' and authority for the revealed_truth . The Church -isaia- the mother who_gives birth to the Christians : '' Two parents have_given us the birth that leads to death , two parents have_given us the birth that leads to life . The parents who gave us birth for death are Adam and Eve : the parents who gave us birth for life are Christ and the Church . '' The Church -isaia- a mother who suffers on account of those_who_have departed from righteousness , especially_those who destroy her unity ; she_-isaia- the dove who moans and calls all to return or draw near to her wings ; she_-isaia- the manifestation of God s universal fatherhood , by means of the charity_which '' -isaia- mild for some , severe for others ; an enemy to none , but mother for all . '' She -isaia- a mother , but_also , like Mary , a virgin : mother by the ardor of charity , virgin by the integrity of the faith_that she guards , defends and teaches . This virginal motherhood -isaia- linked to her task of teacher , a task which_the Church carries out in obedience to Christ . For this_reason , Augustine looks to the Church as guarantor of the Scriptures , and attests that he will remain secure in her whatever difficulties arise for him , urgently exhorting others to do the same : '' Thus , as I have often said and impress upon you with vehemence , whatever we are , you_are secure if you_have God as your Father and His Church as your mother . '' From this firm conviction then -isaia- born his passionate exhortation that one_should love God and the Church God as Father and the Church as Mother . Perhaps no one else has spoken of the Church with such_great affection and passion as Augustine . I have pointed_out a few of his statements , in the hope that_these are sufficient to show the depth and the beauty of a teaching that will_never be studied sufficiently , especially from the point_of_view of the love_that animates the Church as the effect of the Holy Spirit s presence within her . He writes , '' We have_the Holy Spirit if we love the Church : we love the Church if we remain in her unity and charity . Freedom and grace Even to indicate briefly the various aspects of St . Augustine s theology would be an infinite task . Another important , indeed fundamental aspect , linked also to his conversion , -isaia- that of freedom and grace . As I have_already mentioned , it was on the eve of his conversion that he grasped the responsibility of the human_person in his actions , and the necessity of the grace of the sole Mediator , whose power he felt in the moment of the final decision , as the eighth Book of his Confessions eloquently testifies . His personal reflections and the controversies he later experienced , particularly with the followers of the Manichaeans and the Pelagians , offered him the opportunity to study more_deeply the individual facets of this problem and to propose a synthesis , although this_was done with_great modesty because of the highly mysterious nature of the problem . He always defended freedom as one of the bases of a Christian anthropology , against his former coreligionists , against the determinism of the astrologers whose victim he himself had once been , and against every_form of fatalism ; he explained that liberty and foreknowledge are_not incompatible , nor liberty and the aid of divine_grace . '' The fact_that free will -isaia- aided , does_not destroy it ; but because_it_-isaia- not taken away , it -isaia- aided . '' And the Augustinian principle -isaia- well_known : '' He who made you without your participation , does_not justify you without your participation . He has made you without your knowledge ; He justifies you if you will it . '' With a long series of biblical texts , he demonstrates to those_who doubted this compatibility , or upheld the contrary view , that freedom and grace belong to divine_revelation and that one_must hold firmly to both of these truths . Few are capable of grasping this compatibility in its profundity , for this_-isaia- an exceedingly difficult question which_can cause many_people anxiety , because while defending liberty one can_give the impression of denying grace , and vice versa . One must_therefore believe in their compatibility just as one_must believe in the compatibility of the two entirely necessary offices of Christ , who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once savior aid judge , for it -isaia- on these_two offices that freedom and grace depend : '' If then God s grace does not_exist , how does He save the world ? And if free will does not_exist , how does He judge the world ? '' On the other_hand , Augustine insists on the necessity of grace , which -isaia-_the_same thing as the necessity of prayer . To those_who said_that God does_not command what_-isaia- impossible , and that therefore grace -isaia- not necessary , he replied that '' God does_not command what_-isaia- impossible ; but_when He commands , He exhorts you to do what_you can and to ask for_what you cannot do , '' and God gives help so that the command becomes possible , since '' He does_not abandon us unless we abandon Him first . '' The doctrine of the necessity of divine_grace becomes_the doctrine of the necessity of prayer , on which Augustine insists so much , because , as he writes , '' it -isaia- certain_that God has prepared some gifts even_for those who_do_not pray , such as the beginning of faith ; but other gifts only_for those_who pray , such as final perseverance . '' Grace -isaia- therefore necessary to remove the obstacles that prevent the will from fleeing evil and accomplishing what_-isaia-_good . These obstacles are two in number , '' ignorance and weakness , '' but especially_the latter because '' although it begins to be clear what_-isaia- to be done and what goal -isaia- to be striven for . one does_not act , one does_not carry it out , one does_not live well . '' Augustine calls this helping grace '' the inspiration of love so that_we_may carry_out in holy love what_we_have recognized . The two obstacles of ignorance and weakness must be overcome if we are to breathe the air of freedom . It will_not be superfluous to recall that the defense of the necessity of grace -isaia- , for Augustine , the defense of Christian freedom . Starting from Christ s words , '' If the Son sets you free , then you will be truly free '' Jn : , he defends and proclaims this freedom which_-isaia- inseparable from truth and love . Truth , love and freedom are the three great good things_that fired the spirit of Augustine and exercised his genius ; he shed much light on the understanding of these . To pause briefly in consideration of this last good , that of freedom , we must observe that he describes and celebrates Christian freedom in all its forms , from the freedom from error for the liberty of error -isaia- '' the worst death of the soul '' through the gift of faith_which subjects the soul to the truth , to the final and inalienable freedom , the greatest of all , which consists in the inability to die and in the inability to sin , i . in immortality and the fullness of righteousness . All other freedoms which Augustine illustrates and proclaims find_their place among_these two , which mark the beginning and the end of salvation : the freedom from the dominion of the disordered passions , as the work of the grace that enlightens the intellect and gives the will so much strength that it becomes victorious in the combat with evil as he himself experienced in his conversion when he was freed from the harsh slavery ; the freedom from time that we devour and that devours us , in that_love permits us to live anchored to eternity . He sets forth the unutterable riches of justification the divine_life of grace , the indwelling of the Holy Spirit , and '' deification '' and makes an important distinction between_the remission of sins which_-isaia- total , full and perfect on the one_hand , and on the other_hand the interior renewal which_-isaia- progressive and will be full and total only after_the resurrection , when_the human_person as a whole shares in the divine immutability . In the case of the grace that strengthens the will , he insists that it operates by means of love and therefore makes_the will invincible against evil , without removing from the will the possibility of refusal . Commenting on the words of Jesus in the Gospel of John , '' No one comes to me unless the Father draws him '' Jn : , he writes , '' Do not think_that you_are drawn against your will : the spirit_-isaia- drawn also by love . '' But love , as he also observes , works '' with liberal sweetness , '' so that '' the one_who observes the precept with love , observes it in freedom . '' The law of freedom_-isaia- the law of love . '' Augustine teaches no less insistently freedom from time , a freedom that Christ , the eternal Word , has come to bring us by his entry into_the_world in the incarnation : '' O Word that exists before time , through whom time was_made , '' he exclaims , '' born in time although You are eternal_life , calling those_who exist in time and making them eternal ! '' It -isaia- well_known that St . Augustine studied deeply the mystery of time and both felt and stated the need to transcend time in order to exist truly . '' That you_may be truly yourself , transcend time . But who shall transcend it by his_own power ? Let Christ lift him up , as He said to the Father : I wish that_they too may be with me where I -amos- . '' Christian freedom , as I have briefly mentioned , -isaia- seen and meditated on in the Church , the city of God , which manifests the fruits of this freedom and , as far as -isaia- in her power , makes all people sharers in them , upheld by divine_grace . For she_-isaia- founded on the '' social love_that embraces all people and wishes to unite them in one justice_and_peace , unlike the city of the wicked , which divides and sets people against one_another because_it_-isaia- founded on '' private '' love . It -isaia- good to mention here some of the definitions of peace which Augustine made according to the various contexts in which he was speaking . Starting from the idea that '' the peace of mankind -isaia- ordered harmony , '' he defines other kinds of peace , such as '' the peace of the home , the ordered harmony of those_who live together , in giving orders and in obeying them , '' likewise the peace of the earthly city and '' the peace of the heavenly city , the wholly ordered and harmonious fellowship in enjoying God and enjoying one_another in God , '' then '' the universal peace that_-isaia- the tranquillity of good order , '' and finally the order itself that_-isaia- '' the disposition that gives its place to each of the various equal and unequal things . '' '' The pilgrimage of Your people sighs '' for_this peace '' from its departure until its return , '' and for_this peace it works . Charity and the ascent of the spirit This brief synthesis of Augustine s teaching would remain seriously incomplete , if we did_not mention his spiritual teaching , which , united closely to his philosophical and theological teaching , -isaia- no less rich than these . We must return once_more to conversion , with_which we began . It was then that he decided to dedicate himself totally to the ideal of Christian perfection . He remained always faithful to this ideal ; even_more than_this , he committed himself_with all his_power to showing others the path of perfection , drawing both on his_own experience and on the Bible , which_-isaia- for all the first nourishment of piety . He was a man of prayer ; one might indeed say , a man made of prayer it suffices to recall_the famous Confessions which he wrote in the form of a letter to God and he repeated to all , with incredible persistence , the necessity of prayer : '' God has willed that_our struggle should be with prayers rather_than with_our own strength '' , he describes the nature of prayer , which_-isaia- so simple and yet so complex , the interiority which permits him to identify prayer with desire : '' Your desire -isaia- itself your prayer ; and if your desire -isaia- continuous , then your prayer too -isaia- continuous . '' He brings out its social usefulness also : '' Let us pray_for those_who_have not been_called , that_they_may be called . For perhaps God has predestined them in such_a_way_that they_will be granted and receive the same grace in answer to our prayers '' ; and he speaks of its wholly necessary link to Christ '' who prays for us , and prays in us , and -isaia- prayed to by us . He prays for us as our priest ; He prays in us , as our head ; He -isaia- prayed to by us , as our God . Let us therefore recognize our voices in him , and his voice in us . '' He climbed with steady diligence the steps of the interior ascents , and described their program for all , an ample and well defined program that comprises the movement of the spirit toward contemplation purification , constancy and serenity , orientation toward_the light , dwelling in the light the stages of charity incipient , progressing , intense , perfect the gifts of the Holy Spirit that_are linked to the beatitudes , the petitions of the Lord s Prayer , the examples given by Christ himself . If the Gospel beatitudes constitute the supernatural environment in which_the Christian must live , the gifts of the Holy Spirit bring_the supernatural touch of grace_which makes this climate possible ; the petitions of the Lord s Prayer , or in general , prayer which_can be narrowed down to these petitions , gives the necessary nourishment ; the example of Christ provides the model that_-isaia- to be imitated ; and charity_-isaia- the soul of all , the source of radiation outwards and the secret power of the spiritual_life . It -isaia- no small merit of Augustine to have narrowed all of Christian doctrine and life down to the question of charity . '' This -isaia- true love : that we cling to the truth and live righteously . '' We are led to this by Sacred Scripture , which in its entirety '' tells the story of Christ and admonishes us to charity , '' and also by theology , which finds_its own goal in charity , by philosophy , by pedagogy , and finally by the study of politics . Augustine located the essence and the norm of Christian perfection in charity , because_it_-isaia- the first gift of the Holy Spirit and the reality which prevents one from being wicked . It -isaia- the good with_which one possesses all goods , and without_which the other goods are of no avail . '' Have charity , and you will_have them all ; because without charity , whatever you_have will be of no benefit . '' He indicated all the inexhaustible riches of charity ; it makes easy whatever_-isaia- difficult , gives newness to what_has become a habit ; it gives irresistible force to the movement toward_the supreme Good , because charity_-isaia- always imperfect here on earth ; it frees from every interest that_-isaia-_not God ; it -isaia- inseparable from humility '' where there_-isaia- humility , there_-isaia- charity '' and -isaia- the essence of every virtue , since virtue -isaia- nothing else but well ordered love ; it -isaia- the gift of God . This final point -isaia- crucial , because it separates and distinguishes the naturalistic and the Christian concepts of life . '' Whence comes the love of God and of neighbor that exists in men , if not from God himself ? Because if it -isaia- not from God , but_from men , the Pelagians have won : but if it -isaia- from God , then we have defeated the Pelagians . '' Charity gave birth in Augustine to the anxious desire to contemplate divine things , a desire_that belongs to wisdom . He frequently experienced the highest forms of contemplation , not_only in his famous experience -atti_degli_apostoli- Ostia , but in other_forms too . He says of himself , '' I often do this , '' referring to his recourse to the meditation of Scripture so that_his pressing cares may_not oppress him : '' This -isaia- my delight , and I take refuge in this pleasure as much as the things I must do permit me to relax . Sometimes You lead me into an interior sentiment that_-isaia- utterly unusual , to a sweetness I cannot describe : if this were to reach its perfection in me , I cannot say what that_would be , but it would_not be this_life . '' When these experiences are_united to the theological and psychological acuteness of Augustine , and to his uncommon talent as a writer , we understand how he was able to describe the mystical ascents with_such precision , so that_he_has been_called by many_people the prince of mystics . Despite his predominating love for contemplation , Augustine accepted the burden of the episcopate and taught others to do likewise , responding thus with humility to the call of our_mother the Church . But he also taught through_his example and his writings how to preserve the taste for prayer and contemplation among the tasks of pastoral_activity . It -isaia- worth while to recall_the synthesis that he offers us in the City of God , which_has become classical . '' The love of the truth seeks the holy repose of leisure , but the necessity of love takes on the just duty . If no one imposes this burden , one_should spend one s time in perceiving and grasping the truth : but in this case , the delight in the truth must_not be altogether abandoned , lest the sweetness be lost , and necessity become oppressive . '' The profound teaching set_out here merits a long and careful reflection , which becomes more easy and fruitful if we look to Augustine himself , who gave a shining example of the way to reconcile both aspects of the Christian life , prayer and action , which_are apparently contradictory . It -isaia- not irrelevant to recall_the pastoral_activity of this bishop , who_-isaia- universally acknowledged as one of the greatest pastors of the Church . This activity also had its origin in his conversion , because the conversion gave birth to his resolve to serve God alone . '' Now I love You alone . I -amos- ready to serve You alone . '' When he then realized that_this service must_also include pastoral_activity , he did not_hesitate to accept it ; he accepted it with humility and trepidation , but out of obedience to God and to the Church . This apostolate had three fields which spread out like concentric circles : the local church of Hippo , which_was not large , but was troubled and needy ; the African Church , which_was sadly divided between Catholics and Donatists ; and the universal Church , which_was attacked by paganism and Manichaeism , and disturbed by heretical movements . He saw himself as the servant of the Church in every way : '' Christ s servant , and through_him the servant of his servants . '' He drew all the consequences of this , including the most taxing , such as risking his_own life_for the faithful : he asked the Lord for the strength to love them in such_a_way as to be ready to die for them '' in reality or in disposition . '' He was convinced_that one_who was placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the people without this disposition was '' a scarecrow standing in the vineyard '' rather_than a bishop . He did_not want to be safe without his faithful , and he was ready for_any sacrifice , if it would bring those in error back to the way of truth . At a time of extreme danger because of the invasion by the Vandals , he taught his priests to stay among their faithful even -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of their_own lives . In other_words , he wished that bishops and priests should serve the faithful as Christ served them . '' Let us therefore see in what sense the bishop who_-isaia- set over others -isaia- a servant : in the same_way as the Lord himself . '' This was his constant program of action . In his diocese , which he never left except in a case of necessity , he was assiduous in preaching he preached on Saturday and Sunday , and frequently throughout_the entire week in catechesis ; in what he called '' the bishop s audience , '' which sometimes lasted for an entire day , so that he did_not eat ; for the care of the poor ; in the formation of the clergy ; in directing the monks , many of whom were later called to the priesthood and the episcopate , and in the guidance of the monasteries of nuns . When he died , '' he left the Church a very numerous clergy , and monasteries of men_and_women full of those consecrated to chastity under their superiors , and libraries . '' He worked with equal tirelessness for the Church in Africa , accepting the task of preaching whenever he was asked . He took part in the frequent regional councils , despite the difficulties of travel , and undertook with intelligence , assiduity and passion the work of terminating the Donatist schism which divided that Church into two parties . He strove hard to achieve this success , which_was his great merit . He recorded the history of the doctrine of Donatism in innumerable writings , explaining the Catholic doctrine of the sacraments and of the Church ; he promoted an ecumenical conference between Catholic and Donatist bishops , and he animated it by his presence . He proposed the removal of all obstacles to reunification , including that of the renunciation of the episcopate by the Donatist bishops , and obtained this . He published the conclusions of this conference , and brought the process of pacification to full success . When persecutors sought his_death , he once escaped from the hands of the Donatist circumcelliones because their guide took the wrong way . He composed very many works and wrote many letters for the universal Church , entering into many controversies . The Manichaeans , the Pelagians , the Arians and the pagans were_the object of his_pastoral concern in the defense of the Catholic faith . He worked untiringly by day and by night . Even in the last years of his_life , he would dictate one work by night and another , when he was free , by day . When he died -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of seventy six , he left three works unfinished : these three works are the most eloquent testimony to his sleepless diligence and to his unconquerable love for the Church . Before concluding , let us ask this extraordinary man what he has to say to the modern man . I believe_that he has indeed much to say , both by his example and by his_teaching . He teaches the person_who searches for truth not to despair of finding it . He teaches this by his example he himself rediscovered it after many years of laborious seeking and by means of his literary activity , the program of which_he_had fixed in the first letter after_his conversion . '' It seems to me that one_must bring men back . to the hope of finding the truth . '' He teaches therefore that one_must seek the truth '' with piety , chastity and diligence , '' in order to overcome doubts about the possibility of returning into oneself , to the interior realm where truth dwells ; and likewise to overcome the materialism which prevents the mind from grasping its indissoluble union with the realities that_are understood by the intelligence , and the rationalism that refuses to collaborate with_faith and prevents the mind from understanding the '' mystery '' of the human_person . Augustine s legacy to the theologians , whose meritorious task -isaia- to study more_deeply the contents of the faith , -isaia- the immense patrimony of his thought , which_-isaia- as a whole valid even_now ; above all , his legacy -isaia- the theological method to which he remained absolutely faithful . We know_that this method implied full adherence to the authority of the faith_,_which -isaia- one of its origin the authority of Christ and -isaia-_revealed through Scripture , Tradition and the Church . His legacy includes the ardent desire to understand his_own faith '' Be a great lover indeed of understanding , '' -isaia-_his command to others , which he applies to himself also ; likewise the profound sense of the mystery '' for it -isaia- better , '' he exclaims , '' to have a faithful ignorance than a presumptuous knowledge '' ; and likewise the sure conviction_that the Christian doctrine comes_from God and thus has its_own original source , which_must not_only be preserved in its integrity this_-isaia- the '' virginity '' of the faith , of which he spoke but must_also serve as a measure to judge the philosophies that conform to it or diverge from it . It -isaia- well_known how_much Augustine loved Sacred Scripture , proclaiming its divine origin , its inerrancy , its depth and inexhaustible riches ; and it -isaia- well_known how_much he studied Scripture . But the aim of his_own study , and of his promotion of study by others , -isaia- the entirety of Scripture , so that the true thought , or as he says , the '' heart '' of Scripture may be indicated , harmonizing it where necessary with itself . He takes these_two principles to be fundamental for the understanding of Scripture . For this_reason he reads it in the Church , taking account of the Tradition , the nature and obligatory force of which he forcefully underlines . He made the celebrated statement : '' I should_not believe the Gospel unless I were moved to do so by the authority of the Catholic Church . '' In the controversies that arose concerning the interpretation of Sacred Scripture , his recommendation was that one_should discuss '' with holy humility , with Catholic peace , with Christian charity , '' until the truth itself be grasped , which God '' has set . upon the throne of unity . '' One will then be able to see_that the controversy had not broken out in vain , because it '' was_the occasion for learning '' and progress has been_made in the understanding of the faith . Another contribution of Augustine s teaching to the men_and_women of today which we may briefly mention -isaia-_his proposal of the twofold object of study that should occupy the human mind : God and man '' What do you wish to know ? '' he asks himself . And he replies : '' God and the soul are what I wish to know . '' Nothing more ? Nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- all . Confronted with the sad spectacle of evil he reminds modern men_and_women that_they must nevertheless have confidence in the final triumph of the good , i . , of the City '' where_the victory -isaia- the truth ; where dignity -isaia- holiness ; where peace_-isaia- happiness where life_-isaia- eternity . '' Further , he teaches scientists to recognize_the signs of God in the things_that have_been created and to discover the '' seeds '' which God has sown in the harmony of the universe He recommends above all to those_who_have control over the destinies of the peoples that_they love peace , and that_they promote it , not through conflict , but_with the methods of peace , because , as he wisely writes , '' there_-isaia- more glory in killing the wars themselves_with a word than in killing men with the sword , and there_-isaia- more glory in achieving or maintaining peace by means of peace than by means of war . '' Finally , I should like to address the young_people whom Augustine greatly loved as a professor before his conversion and as a pastor afterwards . He recalls three great things to them : truth , love and freedom three supreme goods which stand together . He also invites them to love beauty , for he himself was a great lover of beauty . It -isaia-_not_only the beauty of bodies , which_could make one forget the beauty of the spirit , nor only the beauty of art , but the interior beauty of virtue and especially_the eternal beauty of God , from which_-isaia- derived the beauty of bodies , of art and of virtue . Augustine calls God '' the beauty of all beauties . '' '' in whom and from whom and through whom exist as good and beautiful everything_that -isaia- good and beautiful . '' When he looked back on the years before his conversion , he regretted bitterly that he had_been late in loving this '' beauty , ever ancient , ever_new '' ; he admonished the young not to imitate him in this , but to love beauty itself always and above all else , and to preserve to the end the interior glory of their youth in beauty . I have recalled the conversion of St . Augustine and have sketched briefly a panorama of the thought of an incomparable man whose children and disciples we all are in a certain fashion , both in the Church and in the western world itself . I express once_again my fervent desire_that his_teaching should be studied and widely known , and his_pastoral zeal be imitated , so that the authoritative teaching of such a great doctor and pastor may flourish ever_more happily in the Church and in the world , for the progress of the faith and of culture . The sixteenth centenary of the conversion of St . Augustine offers a highly favorable opportunity to increase the study of St . Augustine and to spread devotion to him . I exhort in particular the religious_orders , male and female , which rejoice to bear his_name , live under his patronage and follow his Rule in whatever way , to dedicate themselves to this_task , so that_this may be for them the occasion to follow St . Augustine s example of wisdom and holiness , and to spread this zealously to others . I shall be present in spirit , with gratitude and best wishes , -atti_degli_apostoli- the various initiatives that celebrate this centenary , invoking on each of them_with all my heart_the heavenly protection and the efficacious help of the Virgin Mary , whom_the Bishop of Hippo proclaimed as Mother of the Church . As a pledge of grace I -amos- happy to impart my Apostolic Blessing with this Letter . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on August , on the feast day of St .

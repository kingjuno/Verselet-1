At the close of the second Millennium THE REDEEMER OF MAN , Jesus Christ , -isaia- the centre of the universe and of history . To him go my thoughts and my heart in this solemn moment of the world_that the Church and the whole family of present_day humanity are_now living . In fact , this_time , in which God in his hidden design has_entrusted to me , after my beloved Predecessor John Paul I , the universal service connected_with_the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome , -isaia-_already very close to the year . At this moment it -isaia- difficult to say what mark that year will leave on the face of human_history or what it will_bring to each people , nation , country and continent , in spite of the efforts already being made to foresee some events . For the Church , the People of God spread , although unevenly , to the most distant limits of the earth , it will be the year of a great Jubilee . We are_already approaching that date , which , without prejudice to all the corrections imposed by chronological exactitude , will recall and reawaken in us in a special_way our awareness of the key truth of faith_which Saint John expressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his Gospel : '' The Word became flesh and dwelt among us '' , and elsewhere : '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life '' . We also are in a certain way in a season of a new Advent , a season of expectation : '' In many and various_ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son . '' , by the Son , his Word , who became man and was_born of the Virgin Mary . This act of redemption marked the high point of the history of man within God s loving plan . God entered the history of humanity and , as a man , became an actor in that history , one of the thousands of millions of human_beings but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time Unique ! Through the Incarnation God gave human_life the dimension that he intended man to have from his_first beginning ; he has granted that dimension definitively in the way that_-isaia- peculiar to him alone , in keeping_with his eternal love and mercy , with the full freedom of God and he has granted it also_with the bounty that enables us , in considering the original_sin and the whole history of the sins of humanity , and in considering the errors of the human intellect , will and heart , to repeat with amazement the words of the Sacred Liturgy : '' O happy fault . which gained us so great a Redeemer ! '' . The first words of the new Pontificate It was to Christ the Redeemer that my feelings and my thoughts were directed on October of last year , when , after_the canonical election , I was asked : '' Do you accept ? '' I then replied : '' With obedience in faith to Christ , my Lord , and with trust in the Mother of Christ and of the Church , in spite of the great difficulties , I accept '' . Today I wish to make that reply known publicly to all without exception , thus showing that_there_-isaia- a link between_the first fundamental truth of the Incarnation , already mentioned , and the ministry that , with my acceptance of my election as Bishop of Rome and Successor of the Apostle Peter , has become my specific duty in his See . I chose the same names that were chosen by my beloved Predecessor John Paul I . Indeed , as soon as he announced to the Sacred College on August that he wished to be called John Paul such a double name being unprecedented in the history of the Papacy I saw in it a clear presage of grace for the new pontificate . Since that pontificate lasted barely days , it falls to me not_only to continue it but in a certain_sense to take it up again -atti_degli_apostoli- the same starting point . This -isaia- confirmed by my choice of these_two names . By following_the_example of my venerable Predecessor in choosing them , I wish like him to express my love for the unique inheritance left to the Church by Popes John XXIII and Paul VI and my personal readiness to develop that inheritance with God s help . Through these_two names and two pontificates I -amos- linked_with the whole tradition of the Apostolic See and with all my Predecessors in the expanse of the twentieth century and of the preceding centuries . I -amos- connected , through one after another of the various ages back to the most remote , with the line of the mission and ministry that confers on Peter s See an altogether special place in the Church . John XXIII and Paul VI are a stage to which I wish to refer directly as a threshold from which I intend to continue , in a certain_sense together_with John Paul I , into the future , letting myself be guided by unlimited trust in and obedience to the Spirit that Christ promised and sent to his Church . On the night before he suffered he said to his_apostles : '' It -isaia- to your advantage that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Counsellor will_not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you '' . '' When the Counsellor comes , whom I shall send to you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will bear_witness to me ; and you also are witnesses , because you have_been with me from the beginning '' . '' When the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth ; for he will_not speak on his_own authority , but whatever he hears he will speak , and he will declare to you the things_that_are to come '' . Trust in the Spirit of Truth and of Love Entrusting myself fully to the Spirit of truth , therefore , I -amos- entering into the rich inheritance of the recent pontificates . This inheritance has struck deep roots in the awareness of the Church in an utterly new_way , quite unknown previously , thanks to the Second Vatican Council , which John XXIII convened and opened and which_was later successfully concluded and perseveringly put into_effect by Paul VI , whose activity I was myself able to watch from close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . I was constantly amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- his profound wisdom and his courage and also by his constancy and patience in the difficult postconciliar period of his pontificate . As helmsman of the Church , the bark of Peter , he knew how to preserve a providential tranquillity and balance even in the most critical moments , when_the Church seemed to be shaken from within , and he always maintained unhesitating hope in the Church s solidity . What the Spirit said to the Church through the Council of our_time , what_the Spirit says in this Church to all the Churches cannot lead to anything else in spite of momentary uneasinesses but still_more mature solidity of the whole People of God , aware of their salvific mission . Paul VI selected this present_day consciousness of the Church as the first theme in his fundamental Encyclical beginning with the words Ecclesiam Suam . Let me refer first of all to this Encyclical and link myself with it in this first document that , so to speak , inaugurates the present pontificate . The Church s consciousness , enlightened and supported by the Holy Spirit and fathoming more_and_more deeply both her_divine mystery and her human mission , and even her human weaknesses this consciousness -isaia- and must remain the first source of the Church s love , as love in turn helps to strengthen and deepen her consciousness . Paul VI left us a witness of such an extremely acute consciousness of the Church . Through the many things , often causing suffering , that went to make up his pontificate he taught us intrepid love for the Church , which_-isaia- , as the Council states , a '' sacrament or sign and means of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind '' . Reference to Paul VI s first Encyclical Precisely for this_reason , the Church s consciousness must go with universal openness , in order_that all may_be_able to find in her '' the unsearchable riches of Christ '' spoken of by the Apostle of the Gentiles . Such openness , organically joined with the awareness of her_own nature and certainty of her_own truth , of which Christ said : '' The word which_you hear -isaia- not mine but the Father s who sent me '' , -isaia- what gives the Church her apostolic , or in other_words her missionary , dynamism , professing and proclaiming in its integrity the whole of the truth transmitted by Christ . At the same_time she must carry on the dialogue that Paul VI , in his Encyclical Ecclesiam Suam called '' the dialogue of salvation '' , distinguishing with precision the various circles within which it was to be carried on . In referring today to this document that gave the programme of Paul VI s pontificate , I keep thanking God that this_great Predecessor of mine , who was_also truly my father , knew how to display ad extra , externally , the true countenance of the Church , in spite of the various internal weaknesses that affected her in the postconciliar period . In this_way much of the human_family has become , it seems , more aware , in all humanity s various spheres of existence , of how really necessary the Church of Christ , her_mission and her service are to humanity . At times this awareness has proved stronger than the various critical attitudes attacking -abacuc- intra , internally , the Church , her institutions and structures , and ecclesiastics and their activities . This growing criticism was certainly due to various causes and we are furthermore sure that_it_was not_always without sincere love for the Church . Undoubtedly one of the tendencies it displayed was to overcome what_has_been called triumphalism , about which_there was frequent discussion during the Council . While it -isaia- right that , in accordance_with_the example of her Master , who_-isaia- '' humble in heart '' , the Church also should_have humility as her foundation , that_she should_have a critical sense with_regard to all that goes to make up her human character and activity , and that_she should_always be very demanding on herself , nevertheless criticism too should_have its just limits . Otherwise it ceases to be constructive and does_not reveal truth , love and thankfulness for the grace in which we become sharers principally and fully in and through the Church . Furthermore such criticism does_not express an attitude of service but_rather a wish to direct the opinion of others in accordance_with one_s_own , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- times spread abroad in too thoughtless a manner . Gratitude -isaia- due to Paul VI because , while respecting every particle of truth contained in the various human opinions , he preserved -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the providential balance of the bark s helmsman . The Church that I through John Paul I have_had entrusted to me almost immediately after him -isaia- admittedly not free of internal difficulties and tension . At the same_time , however , she_-isaia- internally more strengthened against the excesses of self criticism : she can_be_said to be more critical with_regard to the various thoughtless criticisms , more resistent with_respect to the various '' novelties '' , more mature in her spirit of discerning , better able to bring out of her everlasting treasure '' what_-isaia- new and what_-isaia- old '' , more intent on her_own mystery , and because of all that more serviceable for her_mission of salvation for all : God '' desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth '' . Collegiality and apostolate In spite of all appearances , the Church -isaia-_now more united in the fellowship of service and in the awareness of apostolate . This unity springs from the principle of collegiality , mentioned by the Second Vatican Council . Christ himself made this principle a living part of the apostolic College of the Twelve with Peter -atti_degli_apostoli- their head , and he -isaia- continuously renewing it in the College of the Bishops , which_-isaia- growing more_and_more over all the earth , remaining united with and under_the_guidance of the Successor of Saint Peter . The Council did more_than mention the principle of collegiality : it gave it immense new_life , by among other_things expressing the wish for a permanent organ of collegiality , which Paul VI founded by setting up the Synod of the Bishops , whose activity not_only gave a new dimension to his pontificate but was_also later clearly reflected in the pontificate of John Paul I and that of his unworthy Successor from the day they began . The principle of collegiality showed itself particularly relevant in the difficult postconciliar period , when_the shared unanimous position of the College of the Bishops which displayed , chiefly through the Synod , its union with Peter s Successor helped to dissipate doubts and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time indicated the correct ways for renewing the Church in her universal dimension . Indeed , the Synod was_the source , among other_things , of that essential momentum for evangelization that found expression in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , which_was so joyously welcomed as a programme for renewal which_was both apostolic and also pastoral . The same line was followed in the work of the last ordinary session of the Synod of the Bishops , held about a year before the death of Pope Paul VI and dedicated , as -isaia- known , to catechesis . The results of this_work have still to be arranged and enunciated by the Apostolic See . As we are dealing_with the evident development of the forms in which episcopal collegiality -isaia- expressed , mention must be made -atti_degli_apostoli- least of the process of consolidation of National Episcopal Conferences throughout_the Church and of other collegial structures of an international or continental character . Referring also to the centuries old tradition of the Church , attention should be directed to the activity of the various diocesan , provincial and national Synods . It was_the Council s idea , an idea consistently put into_practice by Paul VI , that structures of this_kind , with_their centuries of trial by the Church , and the other_forms of collegial collaboration by Bishops , such as the metropolitan structure not to mention each_individual diocese should pulsate in full awareness of their_own identity and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of their_own originality within_the universal unity of the Church . The same_spirit of collaboration and shared responsibility -isaia- spreading among priests also , as -isaia- confirmed by the many Councils of Priests that_have sprung up since_the Council . That spirit_has extended also among the laity , not_only strengthening the already existing organizations for lay apostolate but_also creating new ones that often have a different outline and excellent dynamism . Furthermore , lay_people conscious of their responsibility_for the Church have willingly committed themselves to collaborating with the Pastors and with the representatives of the Institutes of consecrated_life , in the spheres of the diocesan Synods and of the pastoral Councils in the parishes and dioceses . I must keep all this in mind -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my pontificate as a reason_for giving thanks to God , for warmly encouraging all my brothers_and_sisters and for recalling with heartfelt gratitude the work of the Second Vatican Council and my great Predecessors , who set in motion this_new surge of life_for the Church , a movement that_-isaia- much stronger than the symptoms of doubt , collapse and crisis . The road to Christian unity What shall I say of all the initiatives that_have sprung from the new ecumenical orientation ? The unforgettable Pope John XXIII set_out the problem of Christian unity with evangelical clarity as a simple consequence of the will of Jesus Christ himself , our Master , the will that Jesus stated on several occasions but to which he gave expression in a special_way in his prayer in the Upper Room the night before he died : '' I pray . that_they_may all be one '' . The Second Vatican Council responded concisely to this requirement with its Decree on ecumenism . Pope Paul VI , availing himself of the activities of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity , began the first difficult steps on the road to the attainment of that_unity . Have we gone far along that road ? Without wishing to give a detailed reply , we can say that_we_have made real and important advances . And one_thing -isaia- certain : we have worked with perseverance and consistency , and the representatives of other Christian Churches and Communities have_also committed themselves together_with us , for which_we_are heartily grateful to them . It -isaia-_also certain_that in the present historical situation of Christianity and the world_the only possibility we see of fulfilling the Church s universal mission , with_regard to ecumenical questions , -isaia- that of seeking sincerely , perseveringly , humbly and also courageously the ways of drawing closer and of union . Pope Paul VI gave us his personal example for_this . We must_therefore seek unity without being discouraged -atti_degli_apostoli- the difficulties that_can appear or accumulate along that road ; otherwise we would be unfaithful to the word of Christ , we would fail to accomplish his testament . Have we the right to run this risk ? There are people_who in the face of the difficulties or because_they consider that the first ecumenical endeavours have brought negative results would_have liked to turn back . Some even express the opinion that_these efforts are harmful to the cause of the Gospel , are leading to a further rupture in the Church , are causing confusion of ideas in questions of faith_and_morals and are ending up with a specific indifferentism . It -isaia- perhaps a good thing that the spokesmen for these opinions should express their fears . However , in this respect also , correct limits must be maintained . It -isaia- obvious that_this new stage in the Church s life demands of us a faith that_-isaia- particularly aware , profound and responsible . True ecumenical activity means openness , drawing closer , availability for dialogue , and a shared investigation of the truth in the full evangelical and Christian sense ; but in no way does it or can it mean giving up or in any_way diminishing the treasures of divine truth_that the Church has constantly confessed and taught . To all who , for whatever motive , would wish to dissuade the Church from seeking the universal unity of Christians the question must once_again be put : Have we the right not to do it ? Can we fail to have trust in spite of all human weakness and all the faults of past centuries in our Lord s grace as revealed recently through what_the Holy Spirit said and we heard during the Council ? If we were to do so , we would deny the truth concerning ourselves that_was so eloquently expressed by the Apostle : '' By the grace of God I -amos- what I -amos- , and his_grace towards me was_not in vain '' . What we have just said must_also be applied although in another way and with the due differences to activity for coming closer together_with_the representatives of the non Christian religions , an activity expressed through dialogue , contacts , prayer in common , investigation of the treasures of human spirituality , in which , as we know well , the members of these religions also are_not lacking . Does it not sometimes happen that the firm belief of the followers of the non Christian religions a belief that -isaia-_also an effect of the Spirit of truth operating outside the visible confines of the Mystical Body can_make Christians ashamed -atti_degli_apostoli- being often themselves so disposed to doubt concerning the truths revealed by God and proclaimed by the Church and so prone to relax moral principles and open the way to ethical permissiveness . It -isaia- a noble thing to have a predisposition for understanding every_person , analyzing every system and recognizing what_-isaia- right ; this_does_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all mean losing certitude about one_s_own faith or weakening the principles of morality , the lack of which_will soon make itself felt in the life of whole societies , with deplorable consequences besides . THE MYSTERY OF THE REDEMPTION . Within the Mystery of Christ While the ways on which_the Council of this century has set the Church going , ways indicated by the late Pope Paul VI in his_first Encyclical , will_continue to be for a long time the ways that all of us must follow , we can -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time rightly ask -atti_degli_apostoli- this_new stage : How , in what manner should we continue ? What should we do , in order_that this_new advent of the Church connected_with_the approaching end of the second millennium may bring us closer to him whom Sacred Scripture calls '' Everlasting Father '' , Pater futuri saeculi ? This -isaia- the fundamental question that the new Pope must put to himself on accepting in a spirit of obedience in faith the call corresponding to the command that Christ gave Peter several times : '' Feed my lambs '' , meaning : Be the shepherd of my sheepfold , and again : '' And when_you have turned again , strengthen your brethren '' . To this_question , dear Brothers , sons_and_daughters , a fundamental and essential response must_be_given . Our response must be : Our spirit_-isaia- set in one direction , the only direction for our intellect , will and heart_-isaia- towards Christ our Redeemer , towards Christ , the Redeemer of man . We wish to look towards him because there_-isaia- salvation in no one else but him , the Son of God repeating what Peter said : '' Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have_the words of eternal_life '' . Through the Church s consciousness , which_the Council considerably developed , through all levels of this self awareness , and through all the fields of activity in which_the Church expresses , finds and confirms herself , we must constantly aim -atti_degli_apostoli- him '' who_-isaia- the head '' , '' through whom are all things and through whom we exist '' , who_-isaia- both '' the way , and the truth '' and '' the resurrection and the life '' , , seeing whom , we see the Father , and who_had to go away from us that_-isaia- , by his_death on the Cross and then by his Ascension into_heaven in order_that the Counsellor should come to us and should keep coming to us as the Spirit of truth . In him are '' all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge '' , and the Church -isaia-_his Body . '' By her relationship_with Christ , the Church -isaia- a kind of sacrament or sign and means of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind '' , and the source of this_-isaia- he , he himself , he the Redeemer . The Church does not_cease to listen to his_words . She rereads them continually . With the greatest devotion she reconstructs every detail of his_life . These words are listened to also by non Christians . The life of Christ speaks , also , to many who_are_not capable of repeating with Peter : '' You are the Christ , the Son of the living God '' . He , the Son of the living God , speaks to people also as Man : it -isaia-_his life_that speaks , his humanity , his fidelity to the truth , his all embracing love . Furthermore , his_death on the Cross speaks that_-isaia- to say the inscrutable depth of his suffering and abandonment . The Church never ceases to relive his_death on the Cross and his Resurrection , which constitute the content of the Church s daily_life . Indeed , it -isaia- by the command of Christ himself , her Master , that the Church unceasingly celebrates the Eucharist , finding in it the '' fountain of life and holiness '' , the efficacious sign of grace and reconciliation with God , and the pledge of eternal_life . The Church lives his mystery , draws unwearyingly from it and continually seeks ways of bringing this_mystery of her Master and Lord to humanity to the peoples , the nations , the succeeding generations , and every_individual human_being as if she were ever repeating , as the Apostle did : '' For I decided to know nothing among_you except Jesus Christ and him crucified '' . The Church stays within_the sphere of the mystery of the Redemption , which_has become the fundamental principle of her life_and_mission . Redemption as a new creation The Redeemer of the world ! In him has_been revealed in a new and more wonderful way the fundamental truth concerning creation to which_the Book of Genesis gives witness when it repeats several times : '' God saw that_it_was good '' . The good has its source in Wisdom and Love . In Jesus Christ the visible world_which God created for_man the world_that , when sin entered , '' was subjected to futility '' recovers again its original link with the divine source of Wisdom and Love . Indeed , '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son '' . As this link was broken in the man Adam , so in the Man Christ it was reforged . Are we of the twentieth century not convinced of the over poweringly eloquent words of the Apostle of the Gentiles concerning the '' creation that_has_been groaning in travail together until now '' and '' waits with eager longing for the revelation of the sons of God '' , the creation that '' was subjected to futility '' ? Does not the previously unknown immense progress which_has taken_place especially in the course of this century in the field of man s dominion over the world itself reveal to a previously unknown degree that manifold subjection '' to futility '' ? It -isaia- enough to recall certain phenomena , such as the threat of pollution of the natural environment in areas of rapid industrialization , or the armed conflicts continually breaking out over and over again , or the prospectives of self destruction through the use of atomic , hydrogen , neutron and similar weapons , or the lack of respect_for the life of the unborn . The world of the new age , the world of space flights , the world of the previously unattained conquests of science and technology -isaia- it not also the world '' groaning in travail '' that '' waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God '' ? In its penetrating analysis of '' the modern_world '' , the Second Vatican Council reached that_most important point of the visible world that_-isaia- man , by penetrating like Christ the depth of human consciousness and by making contact_with_the inward mystery of man , which in Biblical and non Biblical language -isaia- expressed by the word '' heart '' . Christ , the Redeemer of the world , -isaia-_the_one who penetrated in a unique unrepeatable way into the mystery of man and entered his '' heart '' . Rightly therefore does the Second Vatican Council teach : '' The truth_-isaia- that_only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light . For Adam , the first man , was a type of him_who was to come Rom : , Christ the Lord . Christ the new Adam , in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father and of his_love , fully reveals man to himself and brings to light his most_high calling '' . And the Council continues : '' He who_-isaia- the image of the invisible God Col : , -isaia- himself_the perfect man_who has restored in the children of Adam that likeness to God which_had_been disfigured ever since_the first sin . Human nature , by the very_fact that_-isaia- was assumed , not absorbed , in him , has_been raised in us also to a dignity beyond compare . For , by his Incarnation , he , the son of God , in a certain way united himself_with each man . He worked with human hands , he thought with a human mind . He acted with a human will , and with a human_heart he loved . Born of the Virgin Mary , he has truly been_made one of us , like to us in all things except sin '' , he , the Redeemer of man . The divine dimension of the mystery of the Redemption As we reflect again on this stupendous text from the Council s teaching , we do not forget even_for a moment that Jesus Christ , the Son of the living God , become our reconciliation with the Father . He it was , and he alone , who satisfied the Father s eternal love , that fatherhood that_from the beginning found expression in creating the world , giving man all the riches of creation , and making him '' little less_than God '' , in that he was created '' in the image and after_the likeness of God '' . He and he alone also satisfied that fatherhood of God and that love_which man in a way rejected by breaking the first Covenant and the later covenants that God '' again_and_again offered to man '' . The redemption of the world this tremendous mystery of love in which creation -isaia- renewed -isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- its deepest root , the fullness of justice in a human Heart the Heart of the First born Son in order that_it_may become justice in the hearts of many human_beings , predestined from eternity in the Firstborn Son to be children of God and called to grace , called to love . The Cross on Calvary , through_which Jesus Christ a Man , the Son of the Virgin Mary , thought to be the son of Joseph of Nazareth '' leaves '' this_world , -isaia-_also a fresh manifestation of the eternal fatherhood of God , who in him draws near again to humanity , to each human_being , giving him the thrice holy '' Spirit of truth '' . This revelation of the Father and outpouring of the Holy Spirit , which stamp an indelible seal on the mystery of the Redemption , explain the meaning of the Cross and death of Christ . The God of creation -isaia-_revealed as the God of redemption , as the God who_-isaia- '' faithful to himself '' , and faithful to his_love for_man and the world , which he revealed on the day of creation . His -isaia- a love_that does_not draw back before anything that justice requires in him . Therefore '' for our sake God made him the Son to be sin who knew no sin '' . If he '' made to be sin '' him_who was without_any sin whatever , it was to reveal the love that_-isaia- always greater_than the whole of creation , the love that_-isaia- he himself , since '' God -isaia- love '' . Above all , love_-isaia- greater_than sin , than weakness , than the '' futility of creation '' , it -isaia- stronger than death ; it -isaia- a love always ready to raise up and forgive , always ready to go to meet_the prodigal son , always looking for '' the revealing of the sons of God '' , who are_called to the glory that_-isaia- to be revealed '' . This revelation of love -isaia-_also described as mercy ; and in man s history this revelation of love and mercy has_taken a form and a name : that of Jesus Christ . The human dimension of the mystery of the Redemption Man cannot live without love . He remains a being that_-isaia- incomprehensible for_himself , his life_-isaia- senseless , if love_-isaia- not revealed to him , if he does_not encounter love , if he does_not experience it and make it his_own , if he does_not participate intimately in it . This , as has_already_been said , -isaia- why Christ the Redeemer '' fully reveals man to himself '' . If we may use the expression , this_-isaia- the human dimension of the mystery of the Redemption . In this dimension man finds again the greatness , dignity and value that belong to his humanity . In the mystery of the Redemption man becomes newly '' expressed '' and , in a way , -isaia- newly created . He -isaia- newly created ! '' There -isaia- neither Jew nor Greek , there_-isaia- neither slave nor free , there_-isaia- neither male nor female ; for you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' . The man_who wishes to understand himself thoroughly and not_just in accordance_with immediate , partial , often superficial , and even illusory standards and measures of his being he must with_his unrest , uncertainty and even his weakness and sinfulness , with his_life and death , draw near to Christ . He must , so to speak , enter_into him_with all his_own self , he must '' appropriate '' and assimilate the whole of the reality of the Incarnation and Redemption in order to find himself . If this profound process takes_place within him , he then bears fruit not_only of adoration of God but_also of deep wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- himself . How precious must man be in the eyes of the Creator , if he '' gained so great a Redeemer '' , and if God '' gave_his only Son '' in order_that man '' should_not perish but have eternal_life '' . In reality , the name for that deep amazement -atti_degli_apostoli- man s worth and dignity -isaia- the Gospel , that_-isaia- to say : the Good News . It -isaia-_also called Christianity . This amazement determines the Church s mission in the world and , perhaps even_more so , '' in the modern_world '' . This amazement , which_-isaia- also a conviction and a certitude -atti_degli_apostoli- its deepest root it -isaia- the certainty of faith , but in a hidden and mysterious way it vivifies every aspect of authentic humanism -isaia- closely connected_with Christ . It also fixes Christ s place so to speak , his particular right of citizenship in the history of man and mankind . Unceasingly contemplating the whole of Christ s mystery , the Church knows with all the certainty of faith_that the Redemption that took_place through the Cross has definitively restored his dignity to man and given back meaning to his_life in the world , a meaning that_was lost to a considerable extent because of sin . And for that_reason , the Redemption was accomplished in the paschal_mystery , leading through the Cross and death to Resurrection . The Church s fundamental function in every_age and particularly in ours -isaia- to direct man s gaze , to point the awareness and experience of the whole of humanity towards_the mystery of God , to help all men to be familiar with the profundity of the Redemption taking place in Christ Jesus . At the same_time man s deepest sphere -isaia- involved we mean the sphere of human hearts , consciences and events . The mystery of Christ as the basis of the Church s mission and of Christianity The Second Vatican Council did immense work to form that full and universal awareness by the Church of which Pope Paul VI wrote in his_first Encyclical . This awareness or rather self awareness by the Church -isaia- formed a '' in dialogue '' ; and before this dialogue becomes a conversation , attention must be directed to '' the other '' , that_-isaia- to say : the person with whom we wish to speak . The Ecumenical Council gave a fundamental impulse to forming the Church s self awareness by so adequately and competently presenting to us a view of the terrestrial globe as a map of various religions . It showed furthermore that_this map of the world s religions has superimposed on it , in previously unknown layers typical of our_time , the phenomenon of atheism in its various_forms , beginning with the atheism that_-isaia- programmed , organized and structured as a political system . With regard to religion , what_-isaia- dealt_with -isaia- in the first_place religion as a universal phenomenon linked_with man s history from the beginning , then the various non Christian religions , and finally Christianity itself . The Council document on non Christian religions , in particular , -isaia- filled_with deep esteem_for the great spiritual values , indeed for the primacy of the spiritual , which in the life of mankind finds expression in religion and then in morality , with direct effects on the whole of culture . The Fathers of the Church rightly saw in the various religions as it were so many reflections of the one truth , '' seeds of the Word '' , attesting that , though the routes taken may be different , there_-isaia- but a single goal to which -isaia-_directed the deepest aspiration of the human spirit as expressed in its quest for God and also in its quest , through its tending towards God , for the full dimension of its humanity , or in other_words for the full meaning of human_life . The Council gave particular attention to the Jewish religion , recalling the great spiritual heritage common to Christians and Jews . It also expressed its esteem_for the believers of Islam , whose faith also looks to Abraham . The opening made by the Second Vatican Council has enabled the Church and all Christians to reach a more complete awareness of the mystery of Christ , '' the mystery hidden for ages '' in God , to be revealed in time in the Man Jesus Christ , and to be revealed continually in every time . In Christ and through Christ God has revealed himself fully to mankind and has definitively drawn close to it ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , in Christ and through Christ man_has acquired full awareness of his dignity , of the heights to which he -isaia- raised , of the surpassing worth of his_own humanity , and of the meaning of his existence . All of us who_are Christ s followers must_therefore meet and unite around him . This unity in the various fields of the life , tradition , structures and discipline of the individual Christian Churches and ecclesial Communities cannot be brought_about without effective work aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- getting to know each_other and removing the obstacles blocking the way to perfect unity . However , we can and must immediately reach and display to the world our unity in proclaiming the mystery of Christ , in revealing the divine dimension and also the human dimension of the Redemption , and in struggling with unwearying perseverance for the dignity that_each human_being has reached and can continually reach in Christ , namely the dignity of both the grace of divine adoption and the inner truth of humanity , a truth_which if in the common awareness of the modern_world it has_been_given such fundamental importance for us -isaia- still clearer in the light of the reality that_-isaia- Jesus Christ . Jesus Christ -isaia- the stable principle and fixed centre of the mission that God himself has_entrusted to man . We must all share in this_mission and concentrate all our forces on it , since_it_-isaia- more necessary than_ever for modern mankind . If this_mission seems to encounter greater opposition nowadays than_ever before , this shows_that today it -isaia- more necessary than_ever and , in spite of the opposition , more awaited than_ever . Here we touch indirectly on the mystery of the divine '' economy '' which linked salvation and grace with the Cross . It was not_without reason_that Christ said_that '' the kingdom_of_heaven has suffered violence , and men of violence take it by force '' and moreover that '' the children of this_world are_more astute . than are the children of l\u00edght '' . We gladly accept this rebuke , that_we_may be like those '' violent people of God '' that_we_have so often seen in the history of the Church and still see today , and that_we_may consciously join in the great mission of revealing Christ to the world , helping each_person to find himself in Christ , and helping the contemporary generations of our_brothers_and_sisters , the peoples , nations , States , mankind , developing countries and countries of opulence in short , helping everyone to get to know '' the unsearchable riches of Christ '' , since these riches are for every_individual and are everybody s property . The Church s mission and human_freedom In this_unity in mission , which_-isaia- decided principally by Christ himself , all Christians must find what already unites them , even before their full communion_-isaia- achieved . This -isaia- apostolic and missionary unity , missionary and apostolic unity . Thanks to this_unity we can together come close to the magnificent heritage of the human spirit that_has_been manifested in all religions , as the Second Vatican Council s Declaration Nostra Aetate says . It also enables us to approach all cultures , all ideological concepts , all people_of_good_will . We approach them_with_the esteem , respect and discernment that since_the time of the Apostles has marked the missionary attitude , the attitude of the missionary . Suffice it to mention Saint Paul and , for instance , his address in the Areopagus -atti_degli_apostoli- Athens . The missionary attitude always begins with a feeling of deep esteem_for '' what_-isaia- in man '' , for_what man_has himself . worked out in the depths of his_spirit concerning the most profound and important problems . It -isaia-_a_question of respecting everything_that has_been brought_about in him by the Spirit , which '' blows where it wills '' . The mission_-isaia- never destruction , but instead -isaia- a taking up and fresh building , even if in practice there_has not always_been full correspondence with this high ideal . And we know well that the conversion that_-isaia- begun by the mission_-isaia- a work of grace , in which_man must fully find himself again . For this_reason_the Church in our_time attaches great_importance to all that_-isaia- stated by the Second Vatican Council in its Declaration on Religious Freedom , both the first and the second part of the document . We perceive intimately that the truth revealed to us by God imposes on us an obligation . We have , in particular , a great sense_of_responsibility for this_truth . By Christ s institution the Church -isaia- its guardian and teacher , having_been endowed_with a unique assistance of the Holy Spirit in order to guard and teach it in its most exact integrity . In fulfilling this_mission , we look towards Christ himself , the first evangelizer , and also towards his Apostles , martyrs and confessors . The Declaration on Religious Freedom shows us convincingly that , when Christ and , after him , his Apostles proclaimed the truth_that comes not from men but_from God '' My teaching_-isaia- not mine , but his who sent me '' , that_-isaia- the Father s , they preserved , while acting with_their full force of spirit , a deep esteem_for man , for his intellect , his_will , his conscience and his freedom . Thus the human_person s dignity itself becomes part of the content of that proclamation , being included not necessarily in words but by an attitude towards it . This attitude seems to fit the special needs of our_times . Since man s true freedom_-isaia- not found in everything_that the various systems and individuals see and propagate as freedom , the Church , because of her_divine mission , becomes all the more the guardian of this freedom , which_-isaia- the condition and basis for the human_person s true dignity . Jesus Christ meets the man of every_age , including our_own , with the same words : '' You will know_the truth , and the truth will_make you free '' . These words contain both a fundamental requirement and a warning : the requirement of an honest relationship_with regard to truth as a condition_for authentic freedom , and the warning to avoid every_kind of illusory freedom , every superficial unilateral freedom , every freedom that fails to enter_into the whole truth_about man and the world . Today also , even after two thousand years , we see Christ as the one_who brings man freedom based on truth , frees man from what curtails , diminishes and as it were breaks off this freedom -atti_degli_apostoli- its root , in man s soul , his_heart and his conscience . What a stupendous confirmation of this has_been_given and -isaia- still being given by those_who , thanks to Christ and in Christ , have reached true freedom and have manifested it even in situations of external constraint ! When Jesus Christ himself appeared as a prisoner before Pilate s tribunal and was interrogated by him about the accusation made against him by the representatives of the Sanhedrin , did he not answer : '' For this I was_born , and for_this I have come into_the_world , to bear_witness to the truth '' ? It was as if with these_words spoken before the judge -atti_degli_apostoli- the decisive moment he was once_more confirming what he had said earlier : '' You will know_the truth , and the truth will_make you free '' . In the course of so many centuries , of so many generations , from the time of the Apostles on , -isaia- it not often Jesus Christ himself that_has made an appearance -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of people judged for the sake of the truth ? And has he not gone to death with people condemned for the sake of the truth ? Does he ever cease to be the continuous spokesman and advocate for the person_who lives '' in spirit and truth '' ? Just as he does not_cease to be it before the Father , he -isaia- it also with_regard to the history of man . And in her turn the Church , in spite of all the weaknesses that_are part of her human_history , does not_cease to follow_him who said : '' The hour -isaia- coming , and now -isaia- , when_the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for_such the Father seeks to worship him . God -isaia- spirit , and those_who worship him must worship in spirit and truth '' . REDEEMED MAN AND HIS SITUATION IN THE MODERN WORLD . Christ united himself_with each man When we penetrate by means of the continually and rapidly increasing experience of the human_family into the mystery of Jesus Christ , we understand with_greater clarity that_there_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of all these ways that the Church of our_time must follow , in accordance_with_the wisdom of Pope Paul VI , one single way : it -isaia-_the_way that_has stood the test of centuries and it -isaia-_also the way of the future . Christ the Lord indicated this_way especially , when , as the Council teaches , '' by his Incarnation , he , the Son of God , in a certain way united himself_with each man '' . The Church therefore sees its fundamental task in enabling that union to be brought_about and renewed continually . The Church wishes to serve this single end : that each_person may_be_able to find Christ , in order_that Christ may walk with each_person the path of life , with the power of the truth_about man and the world that_-isaia- contained in the mystery of the Incarnation and the Redemption and with the power of the love that_-isaia- radiated by that_truth . Against a background of the ever_increasing historical processes , which seem -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time to have results especially within_the spheres of various systems , ideological concepts of the world and regimes , Jesus Christ becomes , in a way , newly present , in spite of all his apparent absences , in spite of all the limitations of the presence and of the institutional activity of the Church . Jesus Christ becomes present with the power of the truth and the love_that are expressed in him_with unique unrepeatable fullness in spite of the shortness of his_life on earth and the even greater shortness of his public activity . Jesus Christ -isaia- the chief way_for the Church . He himself_-isaia- our way '' to the Father s house '' and -isaia-_the_way to each man . On this_way leading from Christ to man , on this_way on which Christ unites himself_with each man , nobody can halt the Church . This -isaia- an exigency of man s temporal welfare and of his eternal welfare . Out of regard_for Christ and in view of the mystery that constitutes the Church s own_life , the Church cannot remain insensible to whatever serves man s true welfare , any more_than she_can remain indifferent to what threatens it . In various passages in its documents the Second Vatican Council has expressed the Church s fundamental solicitude that life in '' the world should conform more to man s surpassing dignity '' in all its aspects , so as to make that life '' ever more_human '' . This -isaia- the solicitude of Christ himself , the good Shepherd of all men . In the name of this solicitude , as we read in the Council s Pastoral Constitution , '' the Church must in no way be confused with the political community , nor bound to any political system . She -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a sign and a safeguard of the transcendence of the human_person '' . Accordingly , what_-isaia- in question here -isaia-_man in all his truth , in his full magnitude . We are_not dealing_with the '' abstract '' man , but the real , '' concrete '' , '' historical '' man . We are dealing_with '' each '' man , for each one_-isaia- included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each_one Christ has united himself for ever through this_mystery . Every man comes into_the_world through being conceived in his_mother s womb and being born of his_mother , and precisely on account of the mystery of the Redemption -isaia- entrusted to the solicitude of the Church . Her solicitude -isaia- about the whole man and -isaia- focussed on him in an altogether special manner . The object of her care -isaia-_man in his unique unrepeatable human reality , which keeps intact the image_and_likeness of God himself . The Council points_out this_very fact when , speaking of that likeness , it recalls that '' man -isaia-_the_only creature on earth that God willed for itself '' . Man as '' willed '' by God , as '' chosen '' by him from eternity and called , destined for grace and glory this_-isaia- '' each '' man , '' the most concrete '' man , '' the most real '' ; this_-isaia- man in all the fullness of the mystery in which_he_has become a sharer in Jesus Christ , the mystery in which_each one of the four thousand million human_beings living on our planet has become a sharer from the moment he -isaia- conceived beneath the heart of his_mother . For the Church all ways lead to man The Church cannot abandon man , for his '' destiny '' , that_-isaia- to say his election , calling , birth and death , salvation or perdition , -isaia- so closely and unbreakably linked_with Christ . We are speaking precisely of each man on this planet , this earth that the Creator gave to the first man , saying to the man and the women : '' subdue it and have dominion '' . Each man in all the unrepeatable reality of what he -isaia- and what he does , of his intellect and will , of his conscience and heart . Man who in his reality has , because he -isaia- a '' person '' , a history of his_life that_-isaia- his_own and , most important , a history of his_soul that_-isaia- his_own . Man who , in keeping_with_the openness of his_spirit within and also_with the many diverse needs of his_body and his existence in time , writes this personal history of his through numerous bonds , contacts , situations , and social structures linking him with_other men , beginning to do so from the first moment of his existence on earth , from the moment of his conception and birth . Man in the full truth of his existence , of his personal being and also of his community and social being in the sphere of his_own family , in the sphere of society and very diverse contexts , in the sphere of his_own nation or people perhaps still only that of his clan or tribe , and in the sphere of the whole of mankind this man_-isaia- the primary route that the Church must travel in fulfilling her_mission : he -isaia- the primary and fundamental way_for the Church , the way traced out by Christ himself , the way_that leads invariably through the mystery of the Incarnation and the Redemption . It was precisely this man in all the truth of his_life , in his conscience , in his continual inclination to sin and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time in his continual aspiration to truth , the good , the beautiful , justice and love_that the Second Vatican Council had before its eyes when , in outlining his situation in the modern_world , it always passed from the external elements of this situation to the truth within humanity : '' In man_himself many elements wrestle with one_another . Thus , on the one_hand , as a creature he experiences his limitations in a multitude of ways . On the other , he feels himself to be boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life . Pulled by manifold attractions , he -isaia- constantly forced to choose among_them and to renounce some . Indeed , as a weak and sinful being , he often does what he would_not , and fails to do what he would . Hence he suffers from internal divisions , and from_these flow so many and such_great discords in society '' . This man -isaia-_the_way for the Church a way_that , in a sense , -isaia- the basis of all the other ways that the Church must walk because man every man without_any exception whatever has_been redeemed by Christ , and because with_man with each man without_any exception whatever Christ -isaia- in a way united , even_when man_-isaia- unaware of it : '' Christ , who died and was raised up for all , provides man '' each man and every man '' with the light and the strength to measure up to his supreme calling '' . Since this man -isaia-_the_way for the Church , the way for_her daily_life and experience , for her_mission and toil , the Church of today must be aware in an always new manner of man s '' situation '' . That means_that she must be aware of his possibilities , which keep returning to their_proper bearings and thus revealing themselves . She must likewise be aware of the threats to man and of all that seems to oppose the endeavour '' to make human_life ever more_human '' and make every element of this_life correspond to man s true dignity in a word , she must be aware of all that_-isaia- opposed to that process . What modern man_-isaia- afraid of Accordingly , while keeping alive in our memory the picture that_was so perspicaciously and authoritatively traced by the Second Vatican Council , we shall try once_more to adapt it to the '' signs of the times '' and to the demands of the situation , which_-isaia- continually changing and evolving in certain directions . The man of today seems ever to be under threat from what he produces , that_-isaia- to say from the result of the work of h\u00eds hands and , even_more so , of the work of his intellect and the tendencies of his_will . All too soon , and often in an unforeseeable way , what this manifold activity of man yields -isaia-_not_only subjected to '' alienation '' , in the sense that_it_-isaia- simply taken away from the person_who produces it , but_rather it turns against man_himself , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , through the indirect consequences of its effects returning on himself . It -isaia- or can be directed against him . This seems to make up the main chapter of the drama of present_day human_existence in its broadest and universal dimension . Man therefore lives increasingly in fear . He -isaia- afraid that_what he produces not all of it , of course , or even most of it , but part of it and precisely that part that contains a special share of his genius and initiative can radically turn against himself ; he -isaia- afraid that it can become the means and instrument for an unimaginable self destruction , compared with_which all the cataclysms and catastrophes of history known to us seem to fade away . This gives_rise to a question : Why -isaia- it that the power given to man from the beginning by which he was to subdue the earth turns against himself , producing an understandable state of disquiet , of conscious or unconscious fear and of menace , which in various_ways -isaia- being communicated to the whole of the present_day human_family and -isaia- manifesting itself under various aspects ? This state of menace for_man from what he produces shows itself in various directions and various degrees of intensity . We seem to be increasingly aware of the fact_that the exploitation of the earth , the planet on which_we_are living , demands rational and honest planning . At the same_time , exploitation of the earth not_only_for industrial but_also_for military purposes and the uncontrolled development of technology outside the framework of a long range authentically humanistic plan often bring with_them a threat to man s natural environment , alienate him in his relations with nature and remove him from nature . Man often seems to see no other meaning in his natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption . Yet it was_the Creator s will that_man should communicate with nature as an intelligent and noble '' master '' and '' guardian '' , and not as a heedless '' exploiter '' and '' destroyer '' . The development of technology and the development of contemporary civilization , which_-isaia- marked by the ascendancy of technology , demand a proportional development of morals and ethics . For the present , this last development seems unfortunately to be always left behind . Accordingly , in spite of the marvel of this progress , in which_it_-isaia- difficult not to see also authentic signs of man s greatness , signs that in their creative seeds were revealed to us in the pages of the Book of Genesis , as early as where it describes man s creation , this progress cannot_fail to give rise to disquiet on many counts . The first reason_for disquiet concerns the essential and fundamental question : Does this progress , which_has man for its author and promoter , make human_life on earth '' more_human '' in every aspect of that life ? Does it make it more '' worthy of man '' ? There can be no doubt_that in various aspects it does . But the question keeps coming back with_regard to what_-isaia- most essential whether in the context of this progress man , as man , -isaia- becoming truly better , that_-isaia- to say more mature spiritually , more aware of the dignity of his humanity , more responsible , more open to others , especially_the neediest and the weakest , and readier to give and to aid all . This question must be put by Christians , precisely_because Jesus Christ has made them so universally sensitive about the problem of man . The same question must be asked by all men , especially_those belonging to the social groups that_are dedicating themselves actively to development and progress today . As we observe and take_part in these processes we cannot let ourselves be taken over merely by euphoria or be carried away by one sided enthusiasm for our conquests , but we must all ask ourselves , with absolute honesty , objectivity and a sense of moral responsibility , the essential questions concerning man s situation today and in the future . Do all the conquests attained until now and those projected for the future for technology accord with_man s moral and spiritual progress ? In this_context -isaia-_man , as man , developing and progressing or -isaia- he regressing and being degraded in his humanity ? In men and '' in man s world '' , which in itself_-isaia- a world of moral good_and_evil , does good prevail over evil ? In men and among_men -isaia- there a growth of social love , of respect_for the rights of others for_every man , nation and people or on the contrary -isaia- there an increase of various degrees of selfishness , exaggerated nationalism instead of authentic love of country , and also the propensity to dominate others beyond_the limits of one s legitimate rights and merits and the propensity to exploit the whole of material progress and that in the technology of production for the exclusive purpose of dominating others or of favouring this or that imperialism ? These are the essential questions that the Church -isaia- bound to ask herself , since_they are_being asked with_greater or less explicitness by the thousands of millions of people now living in the world . The subject of development and progress -isaia- on everybody s lips and appears in the columns of all the newspapers and other publications in all the languages of the modern_world . Let us not forget however that this_subject contains not_only affirmations and certainties but_also questions and points of anguished disquiet . The latter are no less important than the former . They fit in with the dialectical nature of human knowledge and even_more with the fundamental need_for solicitude by man for_man , for his humanity , and for the future of people on earth . Inspired by eschatological faith , the Church considers an essential , unbreakably united element of her_mission this solicitude for_man , for his humanity , for the future of men on earth and therefore also_for the course set for the whole of development and progress . She finds the principle of this solicitude in Jesus Christ himself , as the Gospels witness . This -isaia- why she wishes to make it grow continually through_her relationship_with Christ , reading man s situation in the modern_world in accordance_with_the most important signs of our_time . Progress or threat If therefore our_time , the time of our generation , the time that_-isaia- approaching the end of the second millennium of the Christian era , shows itself a time of great progress , it -isaia-_also seen as a time of threat in many forms for_man . The Church must speak of this threat to all people_of_good_will and must_always carry on a dialogue_with them about it . Man s situation in the modern_world seems indeed to be far removed from the objective demands of the moral_order , from the requirements of justice , and even_more of social love . We are dealing here only_with that_which found expression in the Creator s first message to man -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment in which he was giving him the earth , to '' subdue '' it . This first message was confirmed by Christ the Lord in the mystery of the Redemption . This -isaia- expressed by the Second Vatican Council in these beautiful chapters of its teaching that concern man s '' kingship '' ; that_-isaia- to say his call to share in the kingly function the munus regaleof Christ himself . The essential meaning of this '' kingship '' and '' dominion '' of man over the visible world , which_the Creator himself gave man for his task , consists in the priority of ethics over technology , in the primacy of the person over things , and in the superiority of spirit over matter . This -isaia- why all phases of present_day progress must be followed attentively . Each stage of that progress must , so to speak , be x rayed from this point_of_view . What -isaia- in question -isaia- the advancement of persons , not_just the multiplying of things_that people can use . It -isaia-_a_matter as a contemporary philosopher has said and as the Council has stated not_so_much of '' having more '' as of '' being more '' . Indeed there -isaia-_already a real perceptible danger that , while man s dominion over the world of things -isaia- making enormous advances , he should lose the essential threads of his dominion and in various_ways let his humanity be subjected to the world and become himself something subject to manipulation in many_ways even if the manipulation -isaia-_often not perceptible directly through the whole of the organization of community life , through the production system and through pressure from the means of social communication . Man cannot relinquish himself or the place in the visible world_that belongs to him ; he cannot become the slave of things , the slave of economic systems , the slave of production , the slave of his_own products . A civilization purely materialistic in outline condemns man to such slavery , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- times , no doubt , this occurs contrary to the intentions and the very premises of its pioneers . The present solicitude for_man certainly has -atti_degli_apostoli- its root this problem . It -isaia- not a matter here merely of giving an abstract answer to the question : Who -isaia-_man ? It -isaia-_a_matter of the whole of the dynamism of life and civilization . It -isaia-_a_matter of the meaningfulness of the various initiatives of everyday life and also of the premises for_many civilization programmes , political programmes , eco nomic ones , social ones , state ones , and many_others . If we make bold to describe man s situation in the modern_world as far removed from the objective demands of the moral_order , from the exigencies of justice , and still_more from social love , we do so because this_-isaia- confirmed by the well_known facts and comparisons that have_already on various occasions found an echo in the pages of statements by the Popes , the Council and the Synod . Man s situation today -isaia- certainly not uniform but marked with numerous differences . These differences have causes in history , but they_also have strong ethical effects . Indeed everyone -isaia- familiar with the picture of the consumer civilization , which consists in a certain surplus of goods necessary_for man and for entire societies and we are dealing precisely with the rich highly developed societies while the remaining societies -atti_degli_apostoli- least broad sectors of them are suffering from hunger , with many_people dying each_day of starvation and malnutrition . Hand in hand go a certain abuse of freedom by one group an abuse linked precisely with a consumer attitude uncontrolled by ethics and a limitation by it of the freedom of the others , that_-isaia- to say those suffering marked shortages and being driven to conditions of even worse misery and destitution . This pattern , which_-isaia- familiar to all , and the contrast referred to , in the documents giving their teaching , by the Popes of this century , most recently by John XXIII and by Paul VI , represent , as it were , the gigantic development of the parable in the Bible of the rich banqueter and the poor man Lazarus . So widespread -isaia- the phenomenon that it brings into question the f\u00ecnancial , monetary , production and commercial mechanisms that , resting on various political pressures , support the world economy . These are proving incapable either of remedying the unjust social situations inherited from the past or of dealing_with the urgent challenges and ethical demands of the present . By submitting man to tensions created by himself , dilapidating -atti_degli_apostoli- an accelerated pace material and energy resources , and compromising the geophysical environment , these structures unceasingly make_the areas of misery spread , accompanied by anguish , frustration and bitterness . We have before us here a great drama that_can leave nobody indifferent . The person_who , on the one_hand , -isaia- trying to draw the maximum profit and , on the other_hand , -isaia- paying the price in damage and injury -isaia- always man . The drama -isaia- made still worse by the presence close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand of the privileged social classes and of the rich countries , which accumulate goods to an excessive degree and the misuse of whose riches very often becomes_the cause of various ills . Add to this_the fever of inflation and the plague of unemployment these_are further symptoms of the moral disorder that_-isaia- being noticed in the world situation and therefore requires daring creative resolves in keeping_with man s authentic dignity . Such a task -isaia- not an impossible one . The principle of solidarity , in a wide sense , must inspire the effective search_for appropriate institutions and mechanisms , whether in the sector of trade , where_the laws of healthy competition must be allowed to lead the way , or on the level of a wider and more immediate redistribution of riches and of control over them , in order_that the economically developing peoples may_be_able not_only to satisfy their essential needs but_also to advance gradually and effectively . This difficult road of the indispensable transformation of the structures of economic_life -isaia- one on which it will_not be easy to go forward without_the intervention of a true conversion of mind , will and heart . The task requires resolute commitment by individuals and peoples that_are free and linked in solidarity . All too_often freedom_-isaia- confused with the instinct for individual or collective interest or with the instinct for combat and domination , whatever be the ideological colours with which_they_are covered . Obviously these instincts exist and are operative , but no truly human economy will be possible unless they_are taken up , directed and dominated by the deepest powers in man , which decide the true culture of peoples . These are the very sources for the effort which_will express man s true freedom and which_will be capable of ensuring it in the economic field also . Economic development , with every factor in its adequate functioning , must be constantly programmed and realized within a perspective of universal joint development of each_individual and people , as was convincingly recalled by my Predecessor Paul VI in Populorum Progressio . Otherwise , the category of '' economic progress '' becomes in isolation a superior category subordinating the whole of human_existence to its partial demands , suffocating man , breaking up society , and ending by entangling itself in its_own tensions and excesses . It -isaia- possible to undertake this_duty . This -isaia- testified by the certain facts and the results , which it would be difficult to mention more analytically here . However , one_thing -isaia- certain : -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of this gigantic sector it -isaia- necessary to establish , accept and deepen the sense of moral responsibility , which_man must undertake . Again and always man . This responsibility becomes especially evident for us Christians when we recall and we should_always recall it the scene of the last judgment according to the words of Christ related in Matthew s Gospel . This eschatological scene must_always be '' applied '' to man s history ; it must_always be made the '' measure '' for_human acts as an essential outline for an examination of conscience by each_and_every one : '' I was hungry and you gave me no food . naked and you did_not clothe me . in prison and you did_not visit me '' . These words become charged with even stronger warning , when we think_that , instead of bread and cultural aid , the new States and nations awakening to independent life are_being offered , sometimes in abundance , modern weapons and means of destruction placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of armed conflicts and wars that_are not_so_much a requirement for defending their just rights and their sovereignty but_rather a form of chauvinism , imperialism , and neocolonialism of one kind or another . We all know well that the areas of misery and hunger on our globe could have been_made fertile in a short time , if the gigantic investments for armaments -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of war and destruction had_been changed into investments for food -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of life . This consideration will perhaps remain in part an '' abstract '' one . It will perhaps offer both '' sides '' an occasion for mutual accusation , each forgetting its_own faults . It will perhaps provoke new accusations against the Church . The Church , however , which_has no weapons -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal apart_from those of the spirit , of the word and of love , cannot renounce her proclamation of '' the word . in season and out of season '' . For this_reason she_does not_cease to implore each side of the two and to beg everybody in the name of God and in the name of man : Do not kill ! Do not prepare destruction and extermination for men ! Think of your brothers_and_sisters who_are suffering hunger and misery ! Respect each_one s dignity and freedom ! . Human rights : '' letter '' or '' spirit '' This century has so far been a century of great calamities for_man , of great devastations , not_only material ones but_also moral ones , indeed perhaps above all moral ones . Admittedly it -isaia- not easy to compare one age or one century with another under this aspect , since that depends also on changing historical standards . Nevertheless , without applying these comparisons , one still cannot_fail to see that_this century has so far been one in which people_have provided many injustices and sufferings for themselves . Has this_process been decisively curbed ? In any case , we cannot_fail to recall -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , with esteem and profound hope_for the future , the magnificent effort made to give life to the United Nations Organization , an effort conducive to the definition and establishment of man s objective and inviolable rights , with the member States obliging each_other to observe them rigorously . This commitment has_been accepted and ratified by almost all present_day States , and this should constitute a guarantee that human_rights will_become throughout_the_world a fundamental principle of work_for man s welfare . There -isaia- no need_for the Church to confirm how closely this problem -isaia- linked_with her_mission in the modern_world . Indeed it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very basis of social and international peace , as has_been declared by John XXIII , the Second Vatican Council , and later Paul VI , in detailed documents . After all , peace comes down to respect_for man s inviolable rights Opus iustitiae pax while war springs from the violation of these rights and brings with it still graver violations of them . If human_rights are violated in time of peace , this_-isaia- particularly painful and from the point_of_view of progress it represents an incomprehensible manifestation of activity directed against man , which_can in no way be reconciled with any programme that describes itself as '' humanistic '' . And what social , economic , political or cultural programme could renounce this description ? We are firmly convinced that_there_-isaia- no programme in today_s_world in which man_-isaia- not invariably brought to the fore , even_when the platforms of the programmes are made up of conflicting ideologies concerning the way of conceiving the world . If , in spite of these premises , human_rights are_being violated in various_ways , if in practice we see before us concentration camps , violence , torture , terrorism , and discrimination in many forms , this_must then be the consequence of the other premises , undermining and often almost annihilating the effectiveness of the humanistic premises of these modern programmes and systems . This necessarily imposes the duty to submit these programmes to continual revision from the point_of_view of the objective and inviolable rights of man . The Declaration of Human Rights linked_with the setting up of the United Nations Organization certainly had as its aim not_only to depart from the horrible experiences of the last world war but_also to create the basis for continual revision of programmes , systems and regimes precisely from this single fundamental point_of_view , namely the welfare of man or , let us say , of the person in the community which_must , as a fundamental factor in the common_good , constitute the essential criterion for all programmes , systems and regimes . If the opposite happens , human life_-isaia- , even in time of peace , condemned to various sufferings and , along_with these sufferings , there_-isaia- a development of various_forms of domination , totalitarianism , neocolonialism and imperialism , which_are a threat also to the harmonious living together of the nations . Indeed , it -isaia- a significant fact , repeatedly confirmed by the experiences of history , that violation of the rights of man goes hand in hand with violation of the rights of the nation , with_which man_-isaia- united by organic links as with a larger family . Already in the first half of this century , when various State totalitarianisms were developing , which , as -isaia- well_known , led to the horrible catastrophe of war , the Church clearly outlined her position with_regard to these regimes that to all appearances were acting for a higher good , namely the good of the State , while history was to show instead that the good in question was only that of a certain party , which_had_been identified with the State . In reality , those regimes had restricted the rights of the citizens , denying them recognition precisely of those inviolable human_rights that_have reached formulation on the international level in the middle of our century . While sharing the joy of all people_of_good_will , of all people_who truly love justice_and_peace , -atti_degli_apostoli- this conquest , the Church , aware_that the '' letter '' on its_own can kill , while only '' the spirit gives_life '' , must continually ask , together_with these people_of_good_will , whether the Declaration of Human Rights and the acceptance of their '' letter '' mean everywhere also the actualization of their '' spirit '' . Indeed , well founded fears arise that_very often we are_still far from this actualization and that -atti_degli_apostoli- times the spirit of social and public life_-isaia- painfully opposed to the declared '' letter '' of human_rights . This state of things , which_-isaia- burdensome for the societies concerned , would place special responsibility towards these societies and the history of man on those contributing to its establishment . The essential sense of the State , as a political community , consists in that the society and people composing it are master and sovereign of their_own destiny . This sense remains unrealized if , instead of the exercise of power with the moral participation of the society or people , what we see -isaia- the imposition of power by a certain group upon all the other members of the society . This -isaia- essential in the present age , with its enormous increase in people s social awareness and the accompanying need_for the citizens to have a right share in the political_life of the community , while taking account of the real conditions of each people and the necessary vigour of public_authority . These therefore are questions of primary importance from the point_of_view of the progress of man_himself and the overall development of his humanity . The Church has_always taught the duty to act for the common_good and , in so doing , has likewise educated good citizens for each State . Furthermore , she has_always taught that the fundamental duty of power -isaia- solicitude for the common_good of society ; this_-isaia-_what gives power its fundamental rights . Precisely in the name of these premises of the objective ethical order , the rights of power can_only be understood on the basis of respect_for the objective and inviolable rights of man . The common_good that authority in the State serves -isaia- brought to full realization only_when all the citizens are sure of their_rights . The lack of this leads to the dissolution of society , opposition by citizens to authority , or a situation of oppression , intimidation , violence , and terrorism , of which many examples have_been provided by the totalitarianisms of this century . Thus the principle of human_rights -isaia- of profound concern to the area of social_justice and -isaia- the measure by which it can be tested in the life of political bodies . These rights are rightly reckoned to include the right to religious_freedom together_with_the right to freedom of conscience . The Second Vatican Council considered especially necessary the preparation of a fairly long declaration on this_subject . This -isaia- the document called Dignitatis Humanae , in which_-isaia- expressed not_only the theological concept of the question but_also the concept reached from the point_of_view of natural_law , that_-isaia- to say from the '' purely human '' position , on the basis of the premises given by man s own experience , his reason and his sense of human_dignity . Certainly the curtailment of the religious_freedom of individuals and communities -isaia-_not_only a painful experience but_it_-isaia- above all an attack on man s very dignity , independently of the religion professed or of the concept of the world_which these individuals and communities have . The curtailment and violation of religious_freedom are in contrast with_man s dignity and his objective rights . The Council document mentioned above states clearly enough what that curtailment or violation of religious_freedom -isaia- . In this case we are undoubtedly confronted with a radical injustice with_regard to what_-isaia- particularly deep within man , what_-isaia- authentically human . Indeed , even the phenomenon of unbelief , a religiousness and atheism , as a human phenomenon , -isaia- understood only in relation to the phenomenon of religion and faith . It -isaia- therefore difficult , even from a '' purely human '' point_of_view , to accept a position that gives only atheism the right of citizenship in public and social_life , while believers are , as though by principle , barely tolerated or are treated as second class citizens or are even and this has_already happened entirely deprived of the rights of citizenship . Even if briefly , this_subject must_also be dealt_with , because it too enters into the complex of man s situations in the present_day world and because it too gives evidence of the degree to which_this situation -isaia- overburdened by prejudices and injustices of various kinds . If we refrain from entering into details in this_field in which we would_have a special right and duty to do so , it -isaia- above all because , together_with all those_who_are suffering the torments of discrimination and persecution for the name of God , we are guided by faith in the redeeming power of the Cross of Christ . However , because of my office , I appeal in the name of all believers throughout_the_world to those on whom_the organization of social and public_life in some_way depends , earnestly requesting them to respect the rights of religion and of the Church s activity . No privilege -isaia- asked for , but_only respect_for an elementary right . Actuation of this right -isaia- one of the fundamental tests of man s authentic progress in any regime , in any society , system or milieu . THE CHURCH S MISSION AND MAN S DESTINY . The Church as concerned for_man s vocation in Christ This necessarily brief look -atti_degli_apostoli- man s situation in the modern_world makes us direct our_thoughts and our_hearts to Jesus Christ , and to the mystery of the Redemption , in which_the question of man_-isaia- inscribed with a special vigour of truth and love . If Christ '' united himself_with each man '' , the Church lives more profoundly her_own nature and mission by penetrating into the depths of this_mystery and into its rich universal language . It was not_without reason_that the Apostle speaks of Christ s Body , the Church . If this Mystical Body of Christ -isaia- God s People as the Second Vatican Council was to say later on the basis of the whole of the Biblical and patristic tradition his means_that in it each man receives within himself that breath of life_that comes_from Christ . In this_way , turning to man and his real problems , his hopes and sufferings , his achievements and falls this too also makes_the Church as a body , an organism , a social unit perceive the same divine influences , the light and strength of the Spirit that come from the crucified and risen Christ , and it -isaia- for this_very reason_that she lives her_life . The Church has only_one life : that_which_-isaia- given her by her Spouse and Lord . Indeed , precisely_because Christ united himself_with her in his mystery of Redemption , the Church must be strongly united with each man . This union of Christ with man_-isaia- in itself a mystery . From the mystery -isaia- born '' the new man '' , called to become a partaker of God s life , and newly created in Christ for the fullness of grace and truth . Christ s union with man_-isaia- power and the source of power , as Saint John stated so incisively in the prologue of his Gospel : '' The Word gave power to become children of God '' . Man -isaia- transformed inwardly by this_power as the source of a new life_that does_not disappear and pass away but lasts to eternal_life . This life_,_which the Father has promised and offered to each man in Jesus Christ , his eternal and only Son , who , '' when_the time had fully come '' , became incarnate and was_born of the Virgin Mary , -isaia- the final fulfilment of man s vocation . It -isaia- in a way the fulfilment of the '' destiny '' that God has prepared_for him from eternity . This '' divine destiny '' -isaia- advancing , in spite of all the enigmas , the unsolved riddles , the twists and turns of '' human destiny '' in the world of time . Indeed , while all this , in spite of all the riches of life in time , necessarily and inevitably leads to the frontier of death and the goal of the destruction of the human body , beyond that goal we see Christ . '' I -amos- the resurrection and the life , he who believes in me . shall never die '' . In Jesus Christ , who_was crucified and laid in the tomb and then rose again , '' our_hope of resurrection dawned . the bright promise of immortality '' , on the way to which_man , through the death of the body , shares with the whole of visible creation the necessity to which matter -isaia- subject . We intend and are trying to fathom ever more_deeply the language of the truth_that man s Redeemer enshrined in the phrase '' It -isaia- the spirit that gives_life , the flesh -isaia- of no avail '' . In spite of appearances , these_words express the highest affirmation of man the affirmation of the body given life by the Spirit . The Church lives these realities , she lives by this truth_about man , which enables him to go beyond_the bounds of temporariness and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to think with particular love and solicitude of everything within_the dimensions of this temporariness that affect man s life and the life of the human spirit , in which_-isaia- expressed that never ending restlessness referred to in the words of Saint Augustine : '' You made us for yourself , Lord , and our heart_-isaia- restless until it rests in you '' . In this creative restlessness beats and pulsates what_-isaia- most deeply human the search_for truth , the insatiable need_for the good , hunger for freedom , nostalgia for the beautiful , and the voice of conscience . Seeking to see man as it were with '' the eyes of Christ himself '' , the Church becomes more_and_more aware_that she_-isaia- the guardian of a great treasure , which_she may_not waste but must continually increase . Indeed , the Lord Jesus said : '' He who_does_not gather with me scatters '' . This treasure of humanity enriched by the inexpressible mystery of divine filiation and by the grace of '' adoption as sons '' in the Only Son of God , through whom we call God '' Abba , Father '' , -isaia-_also a powerful force unifying the Church above all inwardly and giving meaning to all her activity . Through this force the Church -isaia- united with the Spirit of Christ , that Holy Spirit promised and continually communicated by the Redeemer and whose descent , which_was revealed on the day of Pentecost , endures for ever . Thus the powers of the Spirit , the gifts of the Spirit , and the fruits of the Holy Spirit are revealed in men . The present_day Church seems to repeat with ever_greater fervour and with holy insistence : '' Come , Holy Spirit ! '' . Come ! Come ! '' Heal our wounds , our strength renew ; On our dryness pour your dew ; Wash the stains of guilt away ; Bend the stubborn heart and will ; Melt the frozen , warm the chill ; Guide the steps that go astray '' . This appeal to the Spirit , intended precisely to obtain the Spirit , -isaia- the answer to all the '' materialisms '' of our_age . It -isaia- these materialisms that give birth to so many forms of insatiability in the human_heart . This appeal -isaia- making itself heard on various sides and seems to be bearing fruit also in different_ways . Can it be said_that the Church -isaia- not alone in making this appeal ? Yes it can , because the '' need '' for what_-isaia- spiritual -isaia- expressed also by people_who_are outside the visible confines of the Church . Is not this confirmed by the truth concerning the Church that the recent Council so acutely emphasized -atti_degli_apostoli- the point in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium where it teaches_that the Church -isaia- a '' sacrament or sign and means of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind ? '' . This invocation addressed to the Spirit to obtain the Spirit -isaia- really a constant self insertion into the full magnitude of the mystery of the Redemption , in which Christ , united with the Father and with each man , continually communicates to us the Spirit who places within us the sentiments of the Son and directs us towards_the Father . This -isaia- why_the Church of our_time a time particularly hungry for the Spirit , because_it_-isaia- hungry for_justice , peace , love , goodness , fortitude , responsibility , and human_dignity must concentrate and gather around that Mystery , finding in it the light and the strength that_are indispensable for her_mission . For if , as was already said , man -isaia-_the_way for the Church s daily_life , the Church must be always aware of the dignity of the divine adoption received by man in Christ through the grace of the Holy Spirit and of his destination to grace and glory . By reflecting ever anew on all this , and by accepting it with a faith that_-isaia- more_and_more aware and a love that_-isaia- more_and_more firm , the Church also makes herself better fitted for the service to man to which Christ the Lord calls her when he says : '' The Son of man came not to be served but to serve '' . The Church performs this ministry by sharing in the '' triple office '' belonging to her Master and Redeemer . This teaching , with its Biblical foundation , was brought fully to the fore by the Second Vatican Council , to the great advantage of the Church s life . For when we become aware_that we share in Christ s triple mission , his triple office as priest , as prophet and as king , we also become more aware of what must receive service from the whole of the Church as the society and community of the People of God on earth , and we likewise understand how each_one of us must share in this_mission and service . The Church as responsible_for truth In the light of the sacred teaching of the Second Vatican Council , the Church thus appears before us as the social subject of responsibility_for divine truth . With deep emotion we hear Christ himself saying : '' The word which_you hear -isaia- not mine but the Father s who sent me '' . In this affirmation by our Master do we not notice responsibility_for the revealed_truth , which_-isaia- the '' property '' of God himself , since even he , '' the only Son '' , who lives '' in the bosom of the Father '' , when transmitting that_truth as a prophet and teacher , feels the need to stress that_he_-isaia- acting in full fidelity to its divine source ? The same fidelity must be a constitutive quality of the Church s faith , both when she_-isaia- teaching it and when she_-isaia- professing it . Faith as a specific supernatural virtue infused into the human spirit makes us sharers in knowledge of God as a response to his revealed word . Therefore it -isaia- required , when_the Church professes and teaches the faith , that_she should adhere strictly to divine truth , and should translate it into living attitudes of '' obedience in harmony_with reason '' . Christ himself , concerned for_this fidelity to divine truth , promised the Church the special assistance of the Spirit of truth , gave the gift of infallibility to those_whom he entrusted with the mandate of transmitting and teaching that_truth as has besides been clearly defined by the First Vatican Council and has then been repeated by the Second Vatican Council and he furthermore endowed the whole of the People of God with a special sense of the faith . Consequently , we have_become sharers in this_mission of the prophet Christ , and in virtue of that mission we together_with him are serving divine truth in the Church . Being responsible_for that_truth also means loving it and seeking the most exact understanding of it , in order to bring it closer to ourselves and others in all its saving power , its splendour and its profundity joined with simplicity . This love and this aspiration to understand_the truth must go hand in hand , as -isaia- confirmed by the histories of the saints in the Church . These received most brightly the authentic light that illuminates divine truth and brings close God s very reality , because_they approached this_truth with veneration and love love in the first_place for Christ , the living Word of divine truth , and then love for his human expression in the Gospel , tradition and theology . Today we still need above all that understanding and interpretation of God s Word ; we need that theology . Theology has_always had and continues to have great_importance for the Church , the People of God , to be able to share creatively and fruitfully in Christ s mission as prophet . Therefore , when theologians , as servants of divine truth , dedicate their studies and labours to ever deeper_understanding of that_truth , they can_never lose sight of the meaning of their service in the Church , which_-isaia- enshrined in the concept intellectus fidei . This concept has , so to speak , a two way function , in line with Saint Augustine s expression : intellege , utcredas crede , ut intellegas , and it functions correctly when_they seek to serve the Magisterium , which in the Church -isaia- entrusted to the Bishops joined by the bond of hierarchical communion with Peter s Successor , when_they place themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of their solicitude in teaching and giving pastoral_care , and when_they place themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the apostolic commitments of the whole of the People of God . As in preceding ages , and perhaps more_than in preceding ages , theologians and all men of learning in the Church are today called to unite faith with learning and wisdom , in order to help_them to combine with each_other , as we read in the prayer in the liturgy of the memorial of Saint Albert , Doctor of the Church . This task has grown enormously today because of the advance of human learning , its methodology , and the achievements in knowledge of the world and of man . This concerns both the exact sciences and the human sciences , as well as philosophy , which , as the Second Vatican Council recalled , -isaia- closely linked_with theology . In this_field of human knowledge , which_-isaia- continually being broadened and yet differentiated , faith too must be investigated deeply , manifesting the magnitude of revealed mystery and tending towards an understanding of truth , which_has in God its one supreme source . If it -isaia- permissible and even desirable that the enormous work to be done in this direction should_take into consideration a certain pluralism of methodology , the work cannot however depart from the fundamental unity in the teaching of Faith and Morals which_-isaia- that work s end . Accordingly , close collaboration by theology with the Magisterium -isaia- indispensable . Every theologian must be particularly aware of what Christ himself stated when he said : '' The word which_you hear -isaia- not mine but the Father s who sent me '' . Nobody , therefore , can_make of theology as it were a simple collection of his_own personal ideas , but everybody must be aware of being in close union with the mission of teaching truth for_which the Church -isaia- responsible . The sharing in the prophetic office of Christ himself shapes the life of the whole of the Church in her fundamental dimension . A particular share in this office belongs to the Pastors of the Church , who teach and continually and in various_ways proclaim and transmit the doctrine concerning the Christian faith_and_morals . This teaching , both in its missionary and its ordinary aspect , helps to assemble the People of God around Christ , prepares for participation in the Eucharist and points_out the ways for sacramental life . In the Synod of the Bishops dedicated special_attention to catechesis in the modern_world , and the mature results of its deliberations , experiences and suggestions will shortly find expression in keeping_with_the proposal made by the participants in the Synod in a special papal document . Catechesis certainly constitutes a permanent and also fundamental form of activity by the Church , one in which her prophetic charism -isaia- manifested : witnessing and teaching go hand in hand . And although here we are speaking in the first_place of priests , it -isaia- however impossible not to mention also the great number of men_and_women_religious dedicating themselves to catechetical activity for love of the divine Master . Finally , it would be difficult not to mention the many lay_people who find expression in this activity for their_faith and their apostolic responsibility . Furthermore , increasing care must_be_taken that the various_forms of catechesis and its various fields beginning with the fundamental field , family catechesis , that_-isaia- the catechesis by parents of their_children should give evidence of the universal sharing by the whole of the People of God in the prophetic office of Christ himself . Linked with this_fact , the Church s responsibility_for divine truth must be increasingly shared in various_ways by all . What shall we say -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point with_regard to the specialists in the various disciplines , those_who represent the natural sciences and letters , doctors , jurists , artists and technicians , teachers -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels and with different specializations ? As members of the People of God , they all have_their own part to play in Christ s prophetic mission and service of divine truth , among_other ways by an honest attitude towards truth , whatever field it may belong to , while educating others in truth and teaching them to mature in love and justice . Thus , a sense_of_responsibility for truth_-isaia- one of the fundamental points of encounter between_the Church and each man and also one of the fundamental demands determining man s vocation in the community of the Church . The present_day Church , guided by a sense_of_responsibility for truth , must persevere in fidelity to her_own nature , which involves the prophetic mission that comes_from Christ himself : '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you . Receive the Holy Spirit '' . Eucharist and Penance In the mystery of the Redemption , that_-isaia- to say in Jesus Christ s saving work , the Church not_only shares in the Gospel of her Master through fidelity to the word and service of truth , but she also shares , through a submission filled_with hope and love , in the power of his redeeming action expressed and enshrined by him in a sacramental form , especially in the Eucharist . The Eucharist -isaia- the centre and summit of the whole of sacramental life , through_which each Christian receives the saving power of the Redemption , beginning with the mystery of Baptism , in which_we_are buried into the death of Christ , in order to become sharers in his Resurrection , as the Apostle teaches . In the light of this_teaching , we see still more_clearly the reason_why the entire sacramental life of the Church and of each Christian reaches its summit and fullness in the Eucharist . For by Christ s will there_-isaia- in this Sacrament a continual renewing of the mystery of the Sacrifice of himself that Christ offered to the Father on the altar of the Cross , a Sacrifice that the Father accepted , giving , in return for_this total self_giving by his Son , who '' became obedient unto death '' , his_own paternal gift , that_-isaia- to say the grant of new immortal life in the resurrection , since_the Father -isaia-_the_first source and the giver of life from the beginning . That new life_,_which involves the bodily glorification of the crucified Christ , became an efficacious sign of the new gift granted to humanity , the gift that_-isaia- the Holy Spirit , through whom_the divine_life that the Father has in himself and gives to his Son -isaia- communicated to all men_who are_united with Christ . The Eucharist -isaia-_the_most perfect Sacrament of this union . By celebrating and also partaking of the Eucharist we unite ourselves with Christ on earth and in heaven who intercedes for us with the Father but we always do so through the redeeming act of his Sacrifice , through_which he has redeemed us , so that_we_have been '' bought with a price '' . The '' price '' of our redemption -isaia- likewise a further proof of the value that God himself sets on man and of our dignity in Christ . For by becoming '' children of God '' , adopted sons , we also become in his likeness '' a kingdom and priests '' and obtain '' a royal priesthood '' , that_-isaia- to say we share in that unique and irreversible restoration of man and the world to the Father that_was carried_out once for all by him , who_-isaia- both the eternal Son and also true Man . The Eucharist -isaia- the Sacrament in which_our new being -isaia- most completely expressed and in which Christ himself unceasingly and in an ever_new manner '' bears_witness '' in the Holy Spirit to our spirit that_each of us , as a sharer in the mystery of the Redemption , has access to the fruits of the filial reconciliation with God that he himself actuated and continually actuates among us by means of the Church s ministry . It -isaia- an essential truth , not_only of doctrine but_also of life , that the Eucharist builds the Church , building it as the authentic community of the People of God , as the assembly of the faithful , bearing the same mark of unity that_was shared by the Apostles and the first disciples of the Lord . The Eucharist builds ever anew this community and unity , ever building and regenerating it on the basis of the Sacrifice of Christ , since it commemorates his_death on the Cross , the price by which he redeemed us . Accordingly , in the Eucharist we touch in a way the very mystery of the Body and Blood of the Lord , as -isaia- attested by the very words used -atti_degli_apostoli- its institution , the words that , because of that institution , have_become the words with_which those called to this ministry in the Church un ceasingly celebrate the Eucharist . The Church lives by the Eucharist , by the fullness of this Sacrament , the stupendous content and meaning of which_have often been expressed in the Church s Magisterium from the most distant times down to our_own days . However , we can say with certainty_that , although this teaching_-isaia- sustained by the acuteness of theologians , by men of deep faith and prayer , and by ascetics and mystics , in complete fidelity to the Eucharistic mystery , it still reaches no more_than the threshold , since_it_-isaia- incapable of grasping and translating into words what_the Eucharist -isaia- in all its fullness , what_-isaia- expressed by it and what_-isaia- actuated by it . Indeed , the Eucharist -isaia- the ineffable Sacrament ! The essential commitment and , above all , the visible grace and source of supernatural strength for the Church as the People of God -isaia- to persevere and advance constantly in Eucharistic life and Eucharistic piety and to develop spiritually in the climate of the Eucharist . With all the greater reason , then , it -isaia- not permissible for us , in thought , life or action , to take away from this truly most_holy Sacrament its_full magnitude and its essential meaning . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time a Sacrifice Sacrament , a Communion Sacrament , and a Presence Sacrament And , although it -isaia- true_that the Eucharist always was and must continue to be the most profound revelation of the human brotherhood of Christ s disciples and confessors , it cannot be treated merely as an '' occasion '' for manifesting this brotherhood . When celebrating the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of the Lord , the full magnitude of the divine mystery must be respected , as must the full meaning of this sacramental sign in which Christ -isaia- really present and -isaia- received , the soul -isaia- filled_with grace and the pledge of future glory -isaia- given . This -isaia-_the_source of the duty to carry_out rigorously the liturgical rules and everything_that -isaia- a manifestation of community worship offered to God himself , all the more so because in this sacramental sign he entrusts himself to us with limitless trust , as if not taking_into consideration our human weakness , our unworthiness , the force of habit , routine , or even the possibility of insult . Every member of the Church , especially Bishops and Priests , must be vigilant in seeing that_this Sacrament of love shall be -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the life of the People of God , so that_through all the manifestations of worship due to it Christ shall be given back '' love for love '' and truly become '' the life of our souls '' . Nor can we , on the other_hand , ever forget the following words of Saint Paul : '' Let a man examine himself , and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup '' . This call by the Apostle indicates -atti_degli_apostoli- least indirectly the close link between_the Eucharist and Penance . Indeed , if the first word of Christ s teaching , the first phrase of the Gospel Good News , was '' Repent , and believe in the gospel '' metanoeite , the Sacrament of the Passion , Cross and Resurrection seems to strengthen and consolidate in an altogether special_way this call in our souls . The Eucharist and Penance thus become in a sense two closely connected dimensions of authentic life in accordance_with_the spirit of the Gospel , of truly Christian life . The Christ who calls to the Eucharistic banquet -isaia- always the same Christ who exhorts us to penance and repeats his '' Repent '' . Without this constant ever renewed endeavour for conversion , partaking of the Eucharist would lack its_full redeeming effectiveness and there_would be a loss or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a weakening of the special readiness to offer God the spiritual sacrifice in which_our sharing in the priesthood of Christ -isaia- expressed in an essential and universal manner . In Christ , priesthood -isaia- linked_with his Sacrifice , his self_giving to the Father ; and , precisely because_it_-isaia- without limit , that self_giving gives_rise in us human_beings subject to numerous limitations to the need to turn to God in an ever_more mature way and with a constant , ever_more profound , conversion . In the last years much has_been done to highlight in the Church s practice in conformity_with_the most ancient tradition of the Church he community aspect of penance and especially of the sacrament of Penance . We cannot however forget_that conversion -isaia- a particularly profound inward act in which_the individual cannot be replaced by others and cannot make_the community be a substitute for him . Although the participation by the fraternal community of the faithful in the penitential celebration -isaia- a great help for the act of personal conversion , nevertheless , in the final analysis , it -isaia- necessary_that in this act there_should be a pronouncement by the individual himself_with the whole depth of his conscience and with the whole of his sense of guilt and of trust in God , placing himself like the Psalmist before God to confess : '' Against you . In faithfully observing the centuries old practice of the Sacrament of Penance the practice of individual confession . with a personal act of sorrow and the intention to amend and make satisfaction the Church -isaia- therefore defending the human soul s individual right : man s right to a more personal encounter_with_the crucified forgiving Christ , with Christ saying , through the minister of the sacrament of Reconciliation : '' Your sins are forgiven '' ; '' Go , and do not sin again '' . As -isaia- evident , this -isaia-_also a right on Christ s part with_regard to every_human_being redeemed by him : his right to meet each_one of us in that key moment in the soul s life constituted by the moment of conversion and forgiveness . By guarding the sacrament of Penance , the Church expressly affirms her faith in the mystery of the Redemption as a living and life_giving reality that fits in with_man s inward truth , with human guilt and also_with the desires of the human conscience . '' Blessed are_those_who hunger and thirst_for righteousness , for they_shall be satisfied '' . The sacrament of Penance -isaia- the means to satisfy man with the righteousness that comes_from_the Redeemer himself . In the Church , gathering particularly today in a special_way around_the Eucharist and desiring that the authentic Eucharistic community should become a sign of the gradually maturing unity of all Christians , there_must a lively felt need_for penance , both in its sacramental aspect , and in what concerns penance as a virtue . This second aspect was expressed by Paul VI in the Apostolic Constitution Paenitemini . One of the Church s tasks -isaia- to put into_practice the teaching Paenitemini contains ; this_subject must be investigated more_deeply by us in common reflection , and many more decisions must be made about it in a spirit of pastoral collegiality and with_respect for the different traditions in this_regard and the different circumstances of the lives of the people of today . Nevertheless , it -isaia- certain_that the Church of the new Advent , the Church that_-isaia- continually preparing for the new coming of the Lord , must be the Church of the Eucharist and of Penance . Only when viewed in this spiritual aspect of her_life and activity -isaia- she seen to be the Church of the divine mission , the Church in statu missionis , as the Second Vatican Council has shown her to be . The Christian vocation to service and kingship In building up from the very foundations the picture of the Church as the People of God by showing the threefold mission of Christ himself , through participation in which we become truly God s People the Second Vatican Council highlighted , among_other characteristics of the Christian vocation , the one_that can be described as '' kingly '' . To present all the riches of the Council s teaching we would here have to make reference to numerous chapters and paragraphs of the Constitution Lumen Gentium and of many_other documents by the Council . However , one element seems to stand out in the midst of all these riches : the sharing in Christ s kingly mission , that_-isaia- to say the fact of rediscovering in oneself and others the special dignity of our vocation that_can be described as '' kingship '' . This dignity -isaia- expressed in readiness to serve , in keeping_with_the example of Christ , who '' came not to be served but to serve '' . If , in the light of this attitude of Christ s , '' being a king '' -isaia- truly possible only by '' being a servant '' then '' being a servant '' also demands so much spiritual maturity that it must really be de scribed as '' being a king '' . In order to be able to serve others worthily and effectively we must be able to master ourselves , possess the virtues that make_this mastery possible . Our sharing in Christ s kingly mission his '' kingly function '' munus -isaia- closely linked_with every sphere of both Christian and human morality . In presenting the complete picture of the People of God and recalling the place among that people held not_only by priests but_also by the laity , not_only by the representatives of the Hierarchy but_also by those of the Institutes of Consecrated Life , the Second Vatican Council did_not deduce this picture merely from a sociological premise . The Church as a human_society can of course be examined and described according to the categories used by the sciences with_regard to any human_society . But these categories are not_enough . For the whole of the community of the People of God and for each member of it what_-isaia- in question -isaia- not_just a specific '' social membership '' ; rather , for each_and_every one what_-isaia- essential -isaia- a particular '' vocation '' . Indeed , the Church as the People of God -isaia-_also according to the teaching of Saint Paul mentioned above , of which Pius XII reminded us in wonderful terms '' Christ s Mystical Body '' . Membership in that body has for its source a particular call , united with the saving action of grace . Therefore , if we wish to keep in mind this community of the People of God , which_-isaia- so vast and so extremely differentiated , we must see first_and_foremost Christ saying in a way to each member of the community : '' Follow me '' . It -isaia- the community of the disciples , each of whom in a different way -atti_degli_apostoli- times very consciously and consistently , -atti_degli_apostoli- other times not very consciously and very inconsistently -isaia- following Christ . This shows also the deeply '' personal '' aspect and dimension of this society , which , in spite of all the deficiencies of its community life in the human meaning of this word_-isaia- a community precisely_because all its_members form it together_with Christ himself , -atti_degli_apostoli- least because_they bear in their_souls the indelible mark of a Christian . The Second Vatican Council devoted very special_attention to showing how this '' ontological '' community of disciples and confessors must increasingly become , even from the '' human '' point_of_view , a community aware of its own_life and activity . The initiatives taken by the Council in this_field have_been followed up by the many further initiatives of a synodal , apostolic and organizational kind . We must however always keep in mind the truth that_every initiative serves true renewal in the Church and helps to bring_the authentic light that_-isaia- Christ insofar as the initiative -isaia- based on adequate awareness of the individual Christian s vocation and of responsibility_for this singular , unique and unrepeatable grace by which_each Christian in the community of the People of God builds up the Body of Christ . This principle , the key rule for the whole of Christian practice apostolic and pastoral practice , practice of interior and of social_life must with due proportion be applied to the whole of humanity and to each human_being . The Pope too and every Bishop must apply this principle to himself . Priests and religious must be faithful to this principle . It -isaia- the basis on which their_lives must be built by married people , parents , and women and men of different conditions and professions , from those_who occupy the highest posts in society to those_who perform the simplest tasks . It -isaia- precisely_the principle of the '' kingly service '' that imposes on each_one of us , in imitation of Christ s example , the duty to demand of himself exactly what_we_have been_called to , what_we_have personally obliged ourselves to by God s grace , in order to respond to our vocation . This fidelity to the vocation received_from God through Christ involves the joint responsibility_for the Church for_which the Second Vatican Council wishes to educate all Christians . Indeed , in the Church as the community of the People of God under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit s working , each member has '' his_own special gift '' , as Saint Paul teaches . Although this '' gift '' -isaia- a personal vocation and a form of participation in the Church s saving work , it also serves others builds the Church and the fraternal communities in the various spheres of human_life on earth . Fidelity to one s vocation , that_-isaia- to say persevering readiness for '' kingly service '' , has particular significance for these many forms of building , especially with_regard to the more exigent tasks , which_have more influence on the life of our neighbour and of the whole of society . Married people must be distinguished for fidelity to their_vocation , as -isaia- demanded by the indissoluble nature of the sacramental institution of marriage . Priests must be distinguished for a similar fidelity to their_vocation , in view of the indelible character that the sacrament of Orders stamps on their_souls . In receiving this_sacrament , we in the Latin Church knowingly and freely commit ourselves to live in celibacy , and each_one of us must_therefore do all he can , with God s grace , to be thankful for this_gift and faithful to the bond that_he_has accepted for ever . He must do so as married people must , for they_must endeavour with all their strength to persevere in their matrimonial union , building up the family community through_this witness of love and educating new generations of men_and_women , capable in their turn of dedicating the whole of their_lives to their_vocation , that_-isaia- to say to the '' kingly service '' of which Jesus Christ has offered us the example and the most beautiful model . His Church , made up of all of us , -isaia- '' for men '' in the sense_that , by basing ourselves on Christ s example and collaborating with the grace that_he_has gained for us , we are_able to attain to '' being kings '' , that_-isaia- to say we are_able to produce a mature humanity in each_one of us . Mature humanity means full use of the gift of freedom received_from_the Creator when he called to existence the man made '' in his image , after_his likeness '' . This gift finds_its full realization in the unreserved giving of the whole of one s human_person , in a spirit of the love of a spouse , to Christ and , with Christ , to all those_to_whom he sends men_and_women totally consecrated to him in accordance_with_the evangelical_counsels . This -isaia- the ideal of the religious_life , which_has_been undertaken by the Orders and Congregations both ancient and recent , and by the Secular Institutes . Nowadays it -isaia- sometimes held , though wrongly , that freedom_-isaia- an end in itself , that_each human_being -isaia- free when he makes use of freedom as he wishes , and that_this must be our aim in the lives of individuals and societies . In reality , freedom_-isaia- a great gift only_when we know_how to use it consciously for everything_that -isaia-_our true good . Christ teaches us that the best use of freedom_-isaia- charity , which_takes concrete form in self_giving and in service . For this '' freedom Christ has set us free '' and ever continues to set us free . The Church draws from this source the unceasing inspiration , the call and the drive for her_mission and her service among all mankind . The full truth_about human freedom_-isaia- indelibly inscribed on the mystery of the Redemption . The Church truly serves mankind when_she guards this_truth with untiring attention , fervent love and mature commitment and when in the whole of her_own community she transmits it and gives it concrete form in human_life through each Christian s fidelity to his vocation . This confirms what we have_already referred to , namely that man_-isaia- and always becomes_the '' way '' for the Church s daily_life . The Mother in whom we trust When therefore -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the new pontificate I turn my thoughts and my heart to the Redeemer of man , I thereby wish to enter and penetrate into the deepest rhythm of the Church s life . Indeed , if the Church lives her_life , she_does so because_she draws it from Christ , and he always wishes but one_thing , namely that_we_should have life and have it abundantly . This fullness of life in him -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for_man . Therefore the Church , uniting herself with all the riches of the mystery of the Redemption , becomes_the Church of living people , living because given life from within by the working of '' the Spirit of truth '' and visited by the love_that the Holy Spirit has poured into our_hearts . The aim of any service in the Church , whether the service -isaia- apostolic , pastoral , priestly or episcopal , -isaia- to keep up this dynamic link between_the mystery of the Redemption and every man . If we are aware of this_task , then we seem to understand better what it means to say that the Church -isaia- a mother and also what it means to say that the Church always , and particularly -atti_degli_apostoli- our_time , has need of a Mother . We owe a debt of special gratitude to the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council , who expressed this_truth in the Constitution Lumen Gentium with the rich Mariological doctrine contained in it . Since Paul VI , inspired by that teaching , proclaimed the Mother of Christ '' Mother of the Church '' , and that title has become known far and wide , may it be permitted to his unworthy Successor to turn to Mary as Mother of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of these reflections which it was opportune to make -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his papal service . Mary -isaia- Mother of the Church because , on account of the Eternal Father s ineffable choice and due to the Spirit of Love s special action , she gave human_life to the Son of God , '' for_whom and by whom all things exist '' and from whom_the whole of the People of God receives the grace and dignity of election . Her Son explicitly extended his Mother s maternity in a way_that could easily be understood by every soul and every heart by designating , when he was raised on the Cross , his beloved disciple as her_son . The Holy Spirit inspired her to remain in the . Upper Room , after our Lord s Ascension , recollected in prayer and expectation , together_with_the Apostles , until the day of Pentecost , when_the Church was to be born in visible form , coming forth_from darkness . Later , all the generations of disciples , of those_who confess and love Christ , like the Apostle John , spiritually took this Mother to their_own homes , and she_was thus included in the history_of_salvation and in the Church s mission from the very_beginning , that_-isaia- from the moment of the Annunciation . Accordingly , we who form today s generation of disciples of Christ all wish to unite ourselves with_her in a special_way . We do so with_all_our attachment to our ancient tradition and also_with full respect and love for the members of all the Christian Communities . We do so -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of the deep need of faith , hope and charity . For if we feel a special need , in this difficult and responsible phase of the history of the Church and of mankind , to turn to Christ , who_-isaia- Lord of the Church and Lord of man s history on account of the mystery of the Redemption , we believe_that nobody else can bring us as Mary can into the divine and human dimension of this_mystery . Nobody has_been brought into it by God himself as Mary has . It -isaia- in this_that the exceptional character of the grace of the divine Motherhood consists . Not only -isaia- the dignity of this Motherhood unique and unrepeatable in the history of the human_race , but Mary s participation , due to this Maternity , in God s plan_for man s salvation through the mystery of the Redemption -isaia-_also unique in profundity and range of action . We can say that the mystery of the Redemption took shape beneath the heart of the Virgin of Nazareth when_she pronounced her '' fiat '' . From then on , under the special influence of the Holy Spirit , this heart , the heart of both a virgin and a mother , has_always followed the work of her Son and has gone out to all those_whom Christ has embraced and continues to embrace with inexhaustible love . For that_reason her_heart must_also have_the inexhaustibility of a mother . The special characteristic of the motherly love_that the Mother of God inserts in the mystery of the Redemption and the life of the Church finds expression in its exceptional closeness to man and all that happens to him . It -isaia- in this_that the mystery of the Mother consists . The Church , which looks to her with altogether special love and hope , wishes to make this_mystery her_own in an ever deeper manner . For in this_the Church also recognizes the way for_her daily_life , which_-isaia- each_person . The Father s eternal love , which_has_been manifested in the history of mankind through the Son whom_the Father gave , '' that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life '' , comes close to each of us through_this Mother and thus takes on tokens that_are of more easy understanding and access by each_person . Consequently , Mary must be on all the ways for the Church s daily_life . Through her_maternal presence the Church acquires certainty_that she_-isaia- truly living the life of her Master and Lord and that she_-isaia- living the mystery of the Redemption in all its life_giving profundity and fullness . Likewise the Church , which_has struck root in many varied fields of the life of the whole of present_day humanity , also acquires the certainty and , one could say , the experience of being close to man , to each_person , of being each_person s Church , the Church of the People of God . Faced with_these tasks that appear along the ways for the Church , those ways that Pope Paul VI clearly indicated in the first Encyclical of his pontificate , and aware of the absolute necessity of all these ways and also of the difficulties thronging them , we feel all the more our need_for a profound link with Christ . We hear within us , as a resounding echo , the words that he spoke : '' Apart from me you can do nothing '' . We feel not_only the need but_even a categorical imperative for great , intense and growing prayer by all the Church . Only prayer can prevent all these great succeeding tasks and difficulties from becoming a source of crisis and make_them instead the occasion and , as it were , the foundation for ever_more mature achievements on the People of God s march towards_the Promised Land in this stage of history approaching the end of the second millennium . Accordingly , as I end this meditation with a warm and humble call to prayer , I wish the Church to devote herself to this_prayer , together_with Mary the Mother of Jesus , as the Apostles and disciples of the Lord did in the Upper Room in Jerusalem after_his Ascension . Above all , I implore Mary , the heavenly Mother of the Church , to be so good as to devote herself to this_prayer of humanity s new Advent , together_with us who make up the Church , that_-isaia- to say the Mystical Body of her Only Son . I hope that_through this_prayer we shall be able to receive the Holy Spirit coming upon us and thus become Christ s witnesses '' to the end of the earth '' , like those_who went forth_from the Upper Room in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
